 * Event that indicates that a (predefined) definition of a character state set was found in the parsed file.
 * <p>
 * This event may or may not occur in combination with one or more {@link SingleTokenDefinitionEvent}, which 
 * define single tokens (e.g. nucleotides or the gap character) used in this set. If no or only a few of the tokens 
 * implied by the return value of {@link #getSetType()} are defined by nested events, the remaining one are still 
 * assumed to be part of the tokens set.
 * <p>
 * JPhyloIO enumerates some standard token sets in {@link TokenSetType}. Some formats might define additional
 * sets which would be represented as {@link TokenSetType#UNKNOWN}. Application developers would have to rely on 
 * {@link #getLabel()} in such cases, to determine the meaning.
