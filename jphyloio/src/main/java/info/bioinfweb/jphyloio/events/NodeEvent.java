	 * Indicates whether this node is a root of its tree or network. One tree or network may contain alternative
	 * root nodes, but not all formats will support this.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that in case of trees this property indicates that this node can be one (alternative) root in a semantic
	 * sense. The topological representation of the tree is independent of this and only determined by how its nodes 
	 * are linked by edge events. The presence of a root edge defining a length of a tree branch leading to the node 
	 * that is topologically at the root of the tree is also fully independent of this property.
	 * <p>
	 * In <i>NeXML</i> root nodes are identified by having a {@code root="true"} 
	 * <a href="http://nexml.org/doc/schema-1/trees/abstracttrees/#AbstractNode">attribute</a>. In <i>Newick</i> and 
	 * <i>Nexus</i> only the property of the topological root node is modeled by the {@code [&R]} or {@code [&U]}
	 * hot comments preceding a <i>Newick</i> string. The same applies for the {@code rooted} attribute of the {@code phylogeny}
	 * <a href="http://www.phyloxml.org/documentation/version_1.10/phyloxml.xsd.html#h535307528">tag</a> in <i>PhyloXML</i>.
