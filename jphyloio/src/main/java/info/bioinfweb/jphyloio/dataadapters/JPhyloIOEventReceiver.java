	 * This maybe the case, if the writer providing this acceptor was seeking for a specific piece of
	 * information and is (currently) not interested in the remaining events. Data adapter implemented
	 * by applications should consider the return value to allow saving runtime. If event writing goes
	 * on after {@code false} was returned, subsequent events will be ignored but no exception will be
	 * thrown.
	 * <p>
	 * Conversely, a return value of {@code true} does not necessarily mean that more events are expected
	 * in order to complete the expected information.
	 * <p>
	 * Exceptions thrown by this instance should not be caught within any of the {@code write*()} methods
	 * in application implementations of any data adapter (e.g. 
	 * {@link MatrixDataAdapter#writeSequencePartContentData(ReadWriteParameterMap, JPhyloIOEventReceiver, String, long, long)}. 
	 * They will be forwarded by the calling writer and can be handled by the application when 
	 * {@link JPhyloIOEventWriter#writeDocument(DocumentDataAdapter, Writer, ReadWriteParameterMap)}
	 * (or one of the other overloaded versions) are called.

	 *         the current position in the sequence
	 * @throws ClassCastException if an event object was specified that is not an instance of a class associated 
	 *         with its type as document in {@link EventContentType}
	 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs when writing to the underlying stream
