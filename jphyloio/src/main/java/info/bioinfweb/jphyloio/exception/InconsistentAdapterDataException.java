/**
 * Exception which is thrown by an instance of {@link JPhyloIOEventWriter} if the data in the specified {@link DocumentDataAdapter} 
 * or one of its nested adapter classes is inconsistent. (An example could be a sequence event referencing an OTU which is not 
 * defined in the document adapter.)
 * <p>
 * In contrast to {@link JPhyloIOWriterException} this exception is not checked, since implementations of {@link DocumentDataAdapter}
 * and its nested classes are usually expected to produce consistent event streams.
