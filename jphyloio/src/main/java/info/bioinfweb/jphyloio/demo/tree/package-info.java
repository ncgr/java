/**
 * This package contains a demo application that shows how to use <i>JPhyloIO</i> to read and write phylogenetic trees.
 * <p>
 * The example shows how to read the graph-like event structure of <i>JPhyloIO</i> into a hierarchical tree data structure. 
 * Beyond that, it is kept simple, so no branch lengths or node and branch metadata are read or OTU links are processed.
 * <p>
 * As this example application is GUI based, it also demonstrates the usage of the file filters provided with 
 * <i>JPhyloIO</i>.
