/**
 * The main JPhyloIO interface to be implemented by all format specific event writers.

 * Instances of this interface access application data through an instance of {@link DocumentDataAdapter} that
 * is passed to a {@code writeDocument()} method. Such an instance links other nested data adapters. Implementations
 * of the adapters will usually be made in application code (based on abstract implementations provided by <i>JPhyloIO</i>)
 * and mediate between instances of this class and the classes implementing the application's data model.
