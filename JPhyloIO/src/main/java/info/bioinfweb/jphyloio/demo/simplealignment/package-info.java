/**
 * This package contains a demo application that shows how to use <i>JPhyloIO</i> to read and write alignment data.
 * <p>
 * The example is meant to provide a basic overview on how to use the library. Therefore it is kept simple, so only sequences 
 * and their tokens are handled and stored in a simple example business model. It does not show more advanced tasks handling 
 * of metadata or OTU-linking and also ignores possible tree or set data.
