 * Event that indicates a defined character (alignment column).

 * Events of this type are optional and most readers will create them only if a character label or
 * associated metadata is present or if an ID has explicitly been defined in the document that is read.
 * <p>
 * Note that only the property {@link #getIndex()} defines the index of the modeled alignment column. There are not necessarily
 * events fired for each column, which is why the index cannot be determined by counting the encountered events of this type.
