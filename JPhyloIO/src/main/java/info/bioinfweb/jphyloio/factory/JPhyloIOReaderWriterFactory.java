/**
 * Factory to create instances of <i>JPhyloIO</i> event readers and writers as well as {@link JPhyloIOFormatInfo} 
 * instances.
 * <p>
 * It provides methods to create instances for a specific format, which is identified by its format ID, such as 
 * {@link #getFormatInfo(String)}, {@link #getWriter(String)} and different versions of {@code getReader()}.
 * Format IDs are defined in {@link JPhyloIOFormatIDs}.
 * <p>
 * Additionally this class allows to guess a format from the data using the available {@code guessFormat()} or 
 * {@code guessFormat()} methods. This is useful if an application user shall be able to load a file in any supported 
 * format without explicitly specifying the format.
 * <p>
 * To be able to guess the format, a certain amount of the data to be read needs to be buffered. The buffer size may 
 * be specified using {@link #setReadAheadLimit(int)}. The default value 
 * ({@link #DEFAULT_READ_AHEAD_LIMIT}{@code = }{@value #DEFAULT_READ_AHEAD_LIMIT} bytes) should be sufficient in most 
 * cases. An increase maybe necessary if unusual files (e.g. XML files with very long header information - such as 
 * {@code ENTITY} declarations - in front of the root tag) are expected.
 * <p>
 * The following examples shows how to obtain a reader for a file with an unknown format:
 * <pre>
 * JPhyloIOEventReader reader = factory.guessReader(new File("path/to/file"), new ReadWriteParameterMap());
 * if (reader != null) {
 *   // read file
 * }
 * else {
 *   System.out.println("The format of the specified file is not supported.");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Internally this instance uses a map from the format IDs to instances of {@link SingleReaderWriterFactory} to
 * create reader and writer instances or guess formats. Third party readers and writers can be handled by this 
 * factory, if according single format factory instances are specified using 
 * {@link #addFactory(SingleReaderWriterFactory)}.
