/**
 * Contains classes that allow push-parsing. <i>JPhyloIO</i> in general is designed to perform pull-parsing, which is often more
 * convenient for application developers. In some cases however pull-parsing maybe necessary, e.g. to use multiple event receivers
 * at the same time. The classes in this package allow to use all <i>JPhyloIO</i> readers with push-parsing.
