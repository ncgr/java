/**
 * This exception is thrown by implementations of {@link JPhyloIOEventReader} if a feature of their format is encountered
 * that is not supported by this reader. Not all readers necessarily support all features of their format (e.g. because 
 * they are rarely used or because they cannot be supported in event based reading without buffering a significant amount 
 * of data).
 * <p>
 * Refer to the documentation of the single readers to find out, if some features of their source format are not supported.
