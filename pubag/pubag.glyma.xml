    <str name="abstract">The cumulative effects of long-term (1980-1990) tillage and crop rotation management on soil organic C and N concentrations and potential mineralization were determined. Tillage systems studied were conventional moldboard plow tillage and conservation tillage, with various crop rotations including: continuous soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover (SW); continuous corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat cover (CW); and corn-wheat cover-soybean-wheat cover (CWSW). Surface soil (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm depth increments) organic C and N concentrations and potential mineralization were determined for all tillage/rotation combinations in October 1990. After 10 years, surface soil organic C and N concentrations were 67% and 66% higher, respectively, under conservation tillage than plow tillage to a depth of 10 cm. Potential C and N mineralization followed a pattern similar to organic C and N distribution. However, differences in substrate quality below 10 cm indicated that conservation tillage promoted N immobilization. Crop rotation had less effect than tillage on soil organic C and N amounts and potential mineralization. Rotations with higher frequency of corn (CW and CWSW) had higher organic C and N concentrations and C mineralization than SW; crop rotation had no effect on potential N mineralization. Tillage system apparently influenced soil organic matter concentrations and mineralization via crop residue incorporation rather than any effects owing to concentration differences at the soil surface, while the effect of crop rotation was related to amount of crop residues added between 1980 and 1990.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Liquid swine manure can be a resource for providing essential plant nutrients and building soil resources, but its management for maximum productivity with minimum environmental impact is often very difficult. Failure to understand the challenges may result in expectations or even regulations that are impossible to achieve. Our objective is to provide producers and policy makers with information regarding agronomic and environmental challenges of liquid swine manure management based on results from a 6-year study with continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and a corn-soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. rotation in Iowa. Challenges that we encountered are openly discussed to increase the awareness of those people who may ultimately be developing policy and writing manure management legislation. Drainage volume, NO3-N concentrations, and NO3-N leaching loss were spatially variable, being influenced by seasonal precipitation as well as current and past manure application rates. Annual manure applications for continuous corn increased soil-test P and K values because more nutrients were supplied than removed through grain harvest. Biennial applications also increased soil-test P but not K. We suggest developing local manure nutrient databases to guide application rates, using total Kjeldahl N (TKN) values to estimate plant-available N. monitoring manure loads to quantify variability and actual loading rates, and routinely using soil-testing to determine if application rates should be based on P rather than N content in the manure.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Aphid infection reduces soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) yield. Consequently, cultivation of aphid-resistant strains is a promising approach to pest control, and understanding the resistance mechanism is of importance. Here, we characterized the resistance of soybeans to foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani Kaltenbach, at the metabolite level. First, we evaluated aphid mortality and settlement rates on the leaves of two soybean strains, ‘Tohoku149’ and ‘Suzuyutaka’, and found that the former had strong resistance soon after introduction of the aphids. The metabolomic response to aphid introduction was analyzed using capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found the following three features in the profiles: (1) concentrations of citrate, amino acids, and their intermediates were intrinsically higher for Tohoku149 than Suzuyutaka, (2) concentrations of several metabolites producing secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and alkaloids, drastically changed 6h after aphid introduction, and (3) concentrations of TCA cycle metabolites increased in Tohoku149 48h after aphid introduction. We also profiled free amino acids in aphids reared on both soybean strains and under starvation, and found that the profile of the aphids on Tohoku149 was similar to that of the starved aphids, but different to that of aphids on Suzuyutaka. These tests confirmed that aphids suck phloem sap even from Tohoku149. This study demonstrates the metabolomic profiles of both soybean strains and aphids, which will contribute to the molecular level understanding of mechanisms of soybean resistance to aphids.</str>

    <str name="abstract">A novel sensitive method based on tertiary amine labeling for the analysis of gibberellins (GAs) by capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection was proposed. GA3 was tagged with 2-(2-aminoethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidine (AEMP) using N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine (HOOBt) as coupling agents in acetonitrile to produce GA3-AEMP-derivative. The GA3-AEMP-derivative was injected into CE by electrokinetic injection and detected by Ru(bpy)32+-based ECL. The parameters affecting derivatization, detection and separation such as concentration of reactants, detection potential, pH and concentration of separation buffer, were investigated in detail. Under optimum conditions, the linear concentration range for GA3 was from 2.0×10−7 to 1.28×10−4M with a correlation coefficient of 0.9997. The detection limit was 8×10−8M (S/N=3). The relative standard deviations of migration time, peak intensity and peak area for nine continuous injections of 2.0×10−5M GA3-AEMP-derivative were 1.0%, 2.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The developed approach was successfully applied to the determination of total GAs in the stem, leaf and seed of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) with recoveries in the range from 89.6% to 99.3%.</str>

    <str name="abstract">In this study, the Glycine max Jackson cultivar (the relatively drought-sensitive) and the Glycine soja BB52 accession (the drought-tolerant one) were used as the experimental materials. Effects of seed soaking with exogenous soybean isoflavones (daidzin or genistin) on seed germination, and seedlings photosynthesis, relative electrolytic leakage, content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , and anti-oxidative activities were investigated under drought stress conditions. The results showed that, treatments of seed soaking with daidzin or genistin could improve seed germination, and alleviate cell damage, enhance anti-oxidative activities and photosynthesis in drought-stressed seedlings, therefore displayed mitigated effects on soybean drought injury, especially for the drought-sensitive G. max Jackson cultivar. Thus seed soaking with exogenous soybean isoflavones may be a usable approach to enhance drought tolerance of cultivated soybean in practice.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Flight responses of the parasitoid, Microplitis croceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) to two phenological stages of spring host plants (crimson clover, Trifolium incarnatum L., hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Corbiere, and cutleaf geranium, Geranium dissectum L.) and summer host plants (cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., sorghum, Sorghum bicolor L., and soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr.) of Heliothis virescens (F.), were measured in a dual choice situation in a wind tunnel. Preflowering clover was more attractive than preflowering geranium, followed by preflowering vetch. Clover was preferred over geranium in flowering stages as well. No within species differences were detected for the two phenological stages. Preflowering and flowering cotton and soybean were preferred over preflowering and flowering sorghum. The findings could be important in pre-determining release sites for M. croceipes in the field.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels of the global atmosphere and the emissions of heavy metals have risen in recent decades, and these increases are expected to produce an impact on crops and thereby affect yield and food safety. In this study, the effects of elevated CO₂ and fly ash amended soils on trace element accumulation and translocation in the root, stem and seed compartments in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were evaluated. Soybean plants grown in fly ash (FA) amended soil (0, 1, 10, 15, and 25% FA) at two CO₂ regimes (400 and 600ppm) in controlled environmental chambers were analyzed at the maturity stage for their trace element contents. The concentrations of Br, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in roots, stems and seeds in soybeans were investigated and their potential risk to the health of consumers was estimated. The results showed that high levels of CO₂ and lower concentrations of FA in soils were associated with an increase in biomass. For all the elements analyzed except Pb, their accumulation in soybean plants was higher at elevated CO₂ than at ambient concentrations. In most treatments, the highest concentrations of Br, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Pb were found in the roots, with a strong combined effect of elevated CO₂ and 1% of FA amended soils on Pb accumulation (above maximum permitted levels) and translocation to seeds being observed. In relation to non-carcinogenic risks, target hazard quotients (TQHs) were significant in a Chinese individual for Mn, Fe and Pb. Also, the increased health risk due to the added effects of the trace elements studied was significant for Chinese consumers. According to these results, soybean plants grown for human consumption under future conditions of elevated CO₂ and FA amended soils may represent a toxicological hazard. Therefore, more research should be carried out with respect to food consumption (plants and animals) under these conditions and their consequences for human health.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean rust (SBR), caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., has the potential to cause significant economic yield loss in U.S. soybean production. Four single dominant resistance genes have been identified in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] that only confer specific resistance to a few rust isolates that have been tested. Additional resistance genes have been identified in wild perennial relatives, including G. tomentella Hayata (accession PI 483218, 2n = 78). Intersubgeneric hybrids have been created between G. max (cv. Altona) and this G. tomentella accession. Amphiploid hybrid lines (2n = 118) were the result of this hybridization and when further backcrossed to G. max (cv. Clark 63), derived fertile lines (2n = 40) were also generated. Both sets of progeny were screened at the USDA-ARS facility at Ft. Detrick, MD, to determine if the resistance to SBR was inherited in the subsequent populations. The amphiploid hybrid clones still retained the genetic SBR resistance that was found in the G. tomentella parent. However, the derived fertile lines were susceptible. These lines were not screened for SBR resistance following each backcross, which may explain this occurrence. Reinstituting the backcross procedure, while testing for SBR resistance at every generation, could move the SBR resistance gene(s) from G. tomentella to the cultivated soybean G max</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean rust (SBR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, was first discovered in North America in 2004 and has the potential to become a major soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] disease in the USA. Currently, four SBR resistance genes have been identified but not mapped on the soybean genetic linkage map. One of these resistance genes is the Rpp1 gene, which is present in the soybean accession PI 200492 The availability of molecular markers associated with Rpp1 will permit marker-assisted selection and expedite the incorporation of this gene into U.S. cultivars. We compared simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers between ‘Williams 82’ and the BC₅ Williams 82 isoline L85-2378, which contains the Rpp1 resistance allele from the soybean accession PI 200492, for candidate regions that might contain Rpp1 One candidate region was found with the SSR marker BARC_Sct_187 on linkage group G. A population of BC₆F₂:₃ lines segregating for the Rpp1 resistance locus was genotyped in this region on linkage group G followed by inoculation with the P. pachyrhizi isolate India 73-1 in the USDA-ARS Biosafety Level 3 Plant Pathogen Containment Facility at Ft. Detrick, MD. The Rpp1 gene was mapped between SSR markers BARC_Sct_187 and BARC_Sat_064 on linkage group G.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis Mulsant (Coleoptera; Coccinellidae), is an oligophagous insect that accepts leaves of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, as food but exhibits distinct preferences among varieties. It is believed that the basis for discrimination between the resistant PI 229358 and the susceptible cv. ‘Williams' is chemical. By the ablation of chemosensilla on antennae, maxillary palpi, labial palpi, and foretarsi, followed with leaf disc preference tests, we found antennal and maxillary palp chemosensilla to be almost entirely responsible for Mexican bean beetles' discrimination between foliage of the resistant and susceptible genotypes. All appendages, and the epipharynx, were observed by scanning electron microscopy and, except for foretarsi, were found to bear several types of presumably olfactory and gustatory sensilla, which are figured and described. Since behavioral observations show that olfaction is usually sufficient to cause rejection of PI 229358, we conclude that olfactory sensilla mainly on antennae and maxillary palpi are critical in food discrimination in this system.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Experiments were conducted to examine the use of spectral reflectance curves for discriminating between plant species across moisture levels. Weed species and soybean were grown at three moisture levels, and spectral reflectance data and leaf water potential were collected every other day after the imposition of moisture stress at 8 wk after planting. Moisture stress did not reduce the ability to discriminate between species. As moisture stress increased, it became easier to distinguish between species, regardless of analysis technique. Signature amplitudes of the top five bands, discrete wavelet transforms, and multiple indices were promising analysis techniques. Discriminant models created from data set of 1 yr and validated on additional data sets provided, on average, approximately 80%% accurate classification among weeds and crop. This suggests that these models are relatively robust and could potentially be used across environmental conditions in field scenarios.Nomenclature: Soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The present study highlights the protective role of β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) in alleviating cadmium (Cd) stress in soybean. Proteomic analyses revealed that out of 66 differentially abundant protein spots in response to Cd challenge, 17 were common in the leaves of BABA-primed and non-primed plants. Oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain 1 were detected in increase abundance in both groups of leaves. Among the 15 commonly decreased protein spots, the relative intensity levels of heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein, carbonic anhydrase, methionine synthase, and glycine dehydrogenase were partially restored after BABA treatment. Moreover, BABA priming significantly enhanced the abundance of the defense-related protein peroxiredoxin and glycolytic enzymes in response to Cd exposure. Additionally, the impact of Cd on the physiological state of BABA-primed and non-primed plants was analyzed using a biophoton technique. The finding of comparatively low biophoton emission in BABA-primed leaves under Cd stress indicates that these plants experienced less oxidative damage than that of non-primed plants. Proteomic study coupled with biophoton analysis reveals that BABA pretreatment helps the plants to combat Cd stress by modulating plants' defence mechanism as well as activating cellular detoxification system to protect the cells from Cd induced oxidative stress damages.</str>

    <str name="abstract">AIMS: To investigate neuroprotective effects of three major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, and petunidin-3-O-glucoside) isolated from the black soybean (Glycine max L.) cv. Cheongja 3 seed coat against H₂O₂-induced cell death of human brain neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. MAIN METHODS: Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, production and expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and inactivation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades were determined by MTT assay, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Pretreatment with anthocyanins reduced the cytotoxicity of H₂O₂ on SK-N-SH cells, dose-dependently reduced the intracellular ROS level and inactivated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1, Thr845), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins. The HO-1 and Neu1 mRNA levels were increased by H₂O₂ (25μM) and further elevated by the pretreatment with anthocyanins. Sialic acids added to the culture plates not only attenuated the cytotoxicity of H₂O₂ (25μM) but also reduced intracellular ROS level. These results suggest that Cheongja 3 black soybean seed coat anthocyanins have brain neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress (H₂O₂) by inhibiting the activation of ASK1–JNK/p38 pathways, scavenging ROS, stimulating the expression of HO-1 and, more interestingly, recruiting cellular free sialic acids through up-regulation of Neu1 sialidase gene expression. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report indicating potent health benefits of black soybean seed coat anthocyanins in neuroprotection by triggering mobilization of cellular free sialic acid and utilizing it as an additional biological antioxidant in brain neural cells.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Field studies were conducted during the years 2000 to 2003 at Stoneville, MS, to determine the efficacy of fall deep tillage and glyphosate applications on redvine and trumpetcreeper populations and soybean yield in glyphosate-resistant soybean. Fall deep (≈≈45 cm) tillage for 1, 2, and 3 yr reduced redvine density by 95, 88, and 97%%, respectively, compared with shallow (≈≈15 cm) tillage, but deep tillage did not reduce trumpetcreeper density. Glyphosate applied preplant reduced trumpetcreeper density (25 to 44%%), but not redvine density, compared to that with no glyphosate. Glyphosate early postemergence (EPOST) either alone (45 to 67%%) or followed by (fb) late postemergence (LPOST; 59 to 83%%) reduced density of trumpetcreeper, but not of redvine, compared to that with no herbicide. However, dry biomass of both vines was reduced with glyphosate EPOST or LPOST compared to that with no herbicide. Soybean yields were higher with deep tillage vs. shallow tillage, glyphosate preplant application vs. no glyphosate, and glyphosate EPOST either alone or fb LPOST vs. no herbicide. Redvine did not reestablish in 2003, which was after skipping fall deep tillage for 1 yr following three consecutive years of deep tillage compared with shallow tillage. It is possible to manage redvine infestations with fall deep tillage and trumpetcreeper infestations with glyphosate preplant and postemergence (POST) in-crop applications. Integration of fall deep tillage and glyphosate POST applications could be an effective strategy to manage combined infestations of these vines in glyphosate-resistant soybean.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; redvine, Brunnichia ovata (Walt.)

    <str name="abstract">Retinoids have been used as therapeutics for diverse skin diseases, but their side effects limit clinical usage. Here, we report that extracts of two soybeans, Glycine max and Rhynchosia nulubilis, and their ethyl acetate fractions increased the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), and that daidzin and genistin were the major constituents of the active fractions. Daidzin and its aglycone, daidzein, induced transcriptional activity of RAR and RARγ. FRET analysis demonstrated that daidzein, but not daidzin, bound both RAR and RARγ with EC50 values of 28μM and 40μM, respectively. Daidzein increased expression of mRNA of RARγ through direct binding of RAR and recruitment of p300 to the RARγ2 promoter. Further, mRNA and gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 were decreased by daidzein in HaCaT cells. Together, these results indicate that daidzein functions as a ligand of RAR that could be a candidate therapeutic for skin diseases.</str>

    <str name="abstract">There is limited research on relationships between root characteristics and soil chemical properties and processes. Because previous studies have shown specific C compounds may release previously sorbed P and make P more plant-available, crops which contribute to high soil C levels could play an important role in soil P cycling. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether rotation crops had different amounts of root growth, (2) whether different amounts of root growth among the crop species could be related to different levels of soluble soil C and (3) whether there were differences in P concentration among the soils under different crops that could be related to soluble C soil concentration. Roots and soil from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and a forage consisting of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and timothy (Phleum pretense L.) were sampled from the Aroostook Research Farm in Presque Isle, Maine, during the summers of 2003 and 2004 to determine root length density (RLD) and soluble C and P concentrations. Half of the sampled plots were amended with beef manure and half were not amended. Barley and forage consistently had higher RLD than potato or soybean crops. Barley and forage typically had higher concentrations of soluble soil C than potato or soybean, but the differences were significant at only three of the five sampling dates. RLD was significantly correlated to soluble C (r=0.56) only for amended soils on the August 2003 sampling date. For other dates r values were non-significant and ranged from 0.32 to 0.49. As with soil C, soluble soil P levels were typically higher in barley and forage than in potato or soybean crops. Significant differences were detected at four of the five sampling dates. Correlations between soluble C and soluble P were significant at two of the five sampling dates (r = 0.58 and 0.62) in amended soils and one of five sampling dates (r = 0.80) in unamended soils. Although the correlations between RLD and soluble C were not significant at every sampling date, the August 2003 data do suggest a possible effect of roots on soluble C. In addition, significant correlations between soluble C and soluble P at several sampling dates suggest a relationship between these parameters. Therefore cropping systems that include crops with higher amounts of root growth may promote increased soluble soil C levels and enhance P bioavailability.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Ridge tillage is a special conservation tillage method, but the long-term effect of this tillage system on crop yield and soil quality in a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation is largely unknown in the northern Corn Belt of the USA. Our objectives were to compare crop performance and soil condition at three nitrogen-fertilizer levels under ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experiment was started in 1990 at Brookings, SD, on a Barnes clay loam (US soil taxonomy: fine-loamy, mixed Udic Haploboroll; FAO classification: Chernozem). CT included moldboard or chisel plowing, seedbed preparation with tandem disk and field cultivator, and row cultivation. Raised beds under RT were maintained using only row cultivation. Corn grain yield was significantly (p&lt;=0.10) greater on CT than on RT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) corn yield was 6267 kg ha-1 with RT and 6500 kg ha-1 with CT. Soybean grain yield was not significantly (p&lt;=0.10) different between RT and CT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) soybean yield was 1997 kg ha-1 with RT and 2058 kg ha-1 with CT. In 9 of 11 years there was a significant soybean-yield response to N-starter fertilizer. There was no significant accumulation of NO3-N in the top 3 m of soil at the end of 9 years in either tillage treatment (111 kg NO3-N ha-1 under RT and 121 kg NO3-N ha-1 under CT). Soil pH in the top 15 cm was unaffected by tillage (average pH was 6.62). In 1999, soil organic C in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under CT (56 Mg ha-1) than under RT (52 Mg ha-1). Bulk density in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under RT (1.52 g cm-3) than under CT (1.44 g cm-3). Tillage did not have a great effect on grain yield or soil properties. RT can protect soil from erosion because crop residues remain relatively undisturbed on the soil surface in contrast to chisel plow. In this respect, we expect RT to be more sustainable over the long term than chisel plow tillage.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Producers often identify compaction as an important problem, so bulk density is usually included in minimum data sets used to evaluate tillage and crop management effects on soil quality. The hypothesis for this study was that bulk density and associated water content would be useful soil quality indicators for evaluating the transitional effects associated with changing tillage and crop management practices on deep-loess soils. The study was conducted on three deep-loess, field-scale watersheds located in western Iowa, USA. The soils are classified as Haplic Phaeozems, Cumulic-Haplic Phaeozems, and Calcaric Regosols. Watersheds 1 and 2 were converted in 1996 from conventional tillage to no-tillage, while watershed 3 was maintained using ridge-tillage and continuous corn (Zea mays L.), a practice implemented in 1972. Watershed 1 was converted to a corn--soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation while watershed 2 was converted to a 6-year rotation that included corn, soybean, corn plus 3 years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Bulk density and water content were measured at three landscape positions (summit, side-slope, and toe-slope), in 20 mm increments to a depth of 300 mm, five times between September 1996 and May 2000. Organic C and total N were also measured to a depth of 160 mm during the initial sampling. Neither bulk density nor water content showed any significant differences between the two watersheds being converted to no-tillage or between them and the ridge-till watershed. There also were no significant differences among landscape positions. Bulk densities and water contents showed some differences when adjacent sampling dates were compared, but there was no overall or consistent trend. Our results show that bulk density is not a useful soil quality indicator for these soils within the bulk density range encountered (0.8-1.6 Mg m3). Our results also confirm that producers do not necessarily have to worry about increased compaction when using ridge-tillage or changing from conventional to no-tillage practices on these or similar deep-loess soils.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean (Glycine max) is extensively used all over the world due to its nutritional qualities. However, soybean is included in the “big eight” list of food allergens. According to the EU directive 2007/68/EC, food products containing soybeans have to be labeled in order to protect the allergic consumers. Nevertheless, soybeans can still inadvertently be present in food products. The development of analytical methods for the detection of traces of allergens is important for the protection of allergic consumers. Mass spectrometry of marker proteolytical fragments of protein allergens is growingly recognized as a detection method in food control. However, quantification of soybean at the peptide level is hindered due to limited information regarding specific stable markers derived after proteolytic digestion. The aim of this study was to use MALDI-TOF/MS and MS/MS as a fast screening tool for the identification of stable soybean derived tryptic markers which were still identifiable even if the proteins were subjected to various changes at the molecular level through a number of reactions typically occurring during food processing (denaturation, the Maillard reaction and oxidation). The peptides ⁴⁰¹Val-Arg⁴¹⁰ from the G1 glycinin (Gly m 6) and the ⁵¹⁸Gln-Arg⁵²⁸ from the α′ chain of the β-conglycinin (Gly m 5) proved to be the most stable. These peptides hold potential to be used as targets for the development of new analytical methods for the detection of soybean protein traces in processed foods.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Early instar Heliothis zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) established on all stages of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) tested when larvae were confined to plants, although establishment decreased after podset stage and as seeds matured. In tests where larvae were allowed to disperse freely on plants, establishment also decreased as maturity increased, but was much lower in each stage than when confined to plants. Neonate larvae settled more quickly on terminals and expanding trifoliates than on mature trifoliates based on initiation of feeding and movement away from initial sites of placement. The ability of neonate larvae placed a short distance from soybean plants to reach a host was affected by high soil and ambient temperature. The results of these experiments suggest that larval host establishment and spin-down behavior play a major role in the late instar population distribution among soybean fields and that maturity of the host strongly influences that behavior.</str>

    <str name="abstract">To gain insight into genomic relationships between soybean (Glycine max) and Medicago truncatula, eight groups of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs, together spanning 2.60 million base pairs (Mb) in G. max and 1.56 Mb in M. truncatula, were compared through high-resolution physical mapping combined with sequence and hybridization analysis of low-copy BAC ends. Cross-hybridization among G. max and M. truncatula contigs uncovered microsynteny in six of the contig groups and extensive microsynteny in three. Between G. max homoeologous (within genome duplicate) contigs, 85% of coding and 75% of noncoding sequences were conserved at the level of cross-hybridization. By contrast, only 29% of sequences were conserved between G. max and M. truncatula, and some kilobase-scale rearrangements were also observed. Detailed restriction maps were constructed for 11 contigs from the three highly microsyntenic groups, and these maps suggested that sequence order was highly conserved between G. max duplicates and generally conserved between G. max and M. truncatula. One instance of homoeologous BAC contigs in M. truncatula was also observed and examined in detail. A sequence similarity search against the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence identified up to three microsyntenic regions in A. thaliana for each of two of the legume BAC contig groups. Together, these results confirm previous predictions of one recent genome-wide duplication in G. max and suggest that M. truncatula also experienced ancient large-scale genome duplications.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Three lethal-yellow mutants have been identified in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and assigned genetic type collection numbers T218H, T225H, and T362H. Previous genetic evaluation of T362H indicated allelism with T218H and T225H and duplicate-factor inheritance. Our objectives were to confirm the inheritance and allelism of T218H and T225H and to molecularly map the locus and (or) loci conditioning the lethal-yellow phenotype. The inheritance of T218H and T225H was 3 green : 1 lethal yellow in their original parental source germplasm of Glycine max 'Illini' and Glycine max 'Lincoln', respectively. In crosses to unrelated germplasm, a 15 green : 1 lethal yellow was observed. Allelism tests indicated that T218H and T225H were allelic. The molecular mapping population was Glycine max 'Minsoy' x T225H and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used. The first locus, designated y18_1, was located on soybean molecular linkage group B2, between SSR markers Satt474 and Satt534, and linked to each by 4.4 and 13.4 cM, respectively. The second locus, designated y18_2, was located on soybean molecular linkage group D2, between SSR markers Satt543 and Sat_001, and linked to each by 2.2 and 4.4 cM, respectively.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The I locus in soybean (Glycine max) corresponds to a region of chalcone synthase (CHS) gene duplications affecting seed pigmentation. We sequenced and annotated BAC clone 104J7, which harbors a dominant i(i) allele from Glycine max 'Williams 82', to gain insight into the genetic structure of this multigenic region in addition to examining its flanking regions. The 103-kb BAC encompasses a gene-rich region with 11 putatively expressed genes. In addition to six copies of CHS, these genes include: a geranylgeranyltransferase type II beta subunit (E.C.2.5.1.60), a beta-galactosidase, a putative spermine and (or) spermidine synthase (E.C.2.5.1.16), and an unknown expressed gene. Strikingly, sequencing data revealed that the 10.91-kb CHS1, CHS3, CHS4 cluster is present as a perfect inverted repeat separated by 5.87 kb. Contiguous arrangement of CHS paralogs could lead to folding into multiple secondary structures, hypothesized to induce deletions that have previously been shown to effect CHS expression. BAC104J7 also contains several gene fragments representing a cation/hydrogen exchanger, a 40S ribosomal protein, a CBL-interacting protein kinase, and the amino terminus of a subtilisin. Chimeric ESTs were identified that may represent read-through transcription from a flanking truncated gene into a CHS cluster, generating aberrant CHS RNA molecules that could play a role in CHS gene silencing.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) Heterodera glycines is the most devastating pest of soybean in the U.S.A. The resistance response elicited by SCN in soybean is complex, and genes involved in the response to a large extent are unknown and not well characterized. We constructed cDNA libraries made from mRNA extracted from roots of the resistant soybean Glycine max L. Merr. 'Peking' at 12 h, 2 to 4 days, and 6 to 8 days post inoculation with the soybean cyst nematode, population NL1-RHp, similar to race 3. Expressed sequence tag analysis of the libraries provides rapid discovery of genes involved in the response of soybean to the nematode. A total of 3454 cDNA clones were examined from the three libraries, of which 25 cDNAs were derived from nematode RNA. The levels of certain stress-induced genes such as SAM22 and glutathione S-transferase (GST8) were elevated in the SCN-infected roots relative to uninoculated roots. Early defense response genes, particularly ascorbate peroxidase and lipoxygenase, were abundant in the 12-h library. By 6-8 days, the expression of most of those genes was not as abundant, whereas genes coding for unknown proteins and stress-induced proteins continued to be highly expressed. These ESTs and associated information will be useful to scientists examining gene and protein interactions between nematodes and plants.</str>

    <str name="abstract">A field survey of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, and its natural enemies was conducted during summer 2002 in Langfang, northern China (116.4°E, 39.3°N). Aphids colonized soybean when plants were still small in early July. After a lag of 2 wk, aphid density increased rapidly in late July, reaching a peak of 114 ± 46 aphids per five soybean plants on 1 August. The population declined to a plateau immediately after this peak and then declined again starting in mid-August, although a second small peak occurred in late August. The finite rate of increase varied from zero- to five-fold, and the aphid seemed to be limited by natural enemies. The main species of natural enemy were the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus sp., the aphid predators Propylaea japonica (Thunberg), Scymnus (Neopullus) babai Sasaji, and Paragus tibialis (Fallen). In a field exclosure experiment, A. glycines density in small-mesh cages peaked three-fold higher than in large-mesh cages and 12-fold higher than on uncaged plants, indicating that natural enemies did indeed limit aphid density.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Specific leaf weight, percent moisture, and free sugar, starch, and amino nitrogen content of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) leaves were measured at 1, 3, 7, and 10 day(s) after petiole girdling by threecornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus (Say) (Homoptera: Membracidae) nymphs. Leaf starch was increased at 1, 3, and 7 day(s) after girdling and largely accounted for corresponding increases in specific leaf weight and decreases in percent moisture, free sugars, and amino nitrogen. Specific leaf weight was increased at 10 days after girdling despite no increase in starch. Amino nitrogen content was decreased 10 days after girdling. When leaf dry weights were corrected for starch, free sugar content was not affected by girdling, and amino nitrogen content was reduced only at 3 and 10 days. The amino nitrogen: free sugar ratio was reduced only at 10 days after girdling. Changes in leaf starch indicated a rapid but reversible effect of girdling on leaf carbohydrate metabolism.</str>

    <str name="abstract">As a vital component of a number of macromolecules and an integral part of energy metabolism and major biological processes in photosynthesis, respiration, and membrane transportation, as well as playing a genetic role through ribonucleic acid and energy transfers via adenosine triphosphate, phosphorous is indispensable for all life forms and cannot be substituted by any other element. Being the life-limiting element in natural ecosystems, regular inputs of P fertilizer to replenish the P removed from the soil by crops are one of the characteristics of modern agriculture. The demand for P resources will outstrip supply in the coming decades because the global commercial phosphate reserves may be depleted in another 60–130years. In addition, rock phosphate (RP) reserves are under the control of a few countries. The P recovery rate is very low and the surpluses of P in soil have produced variable responses of crops to P fertilizers and environmental pollution. Requirements for direct application of RP and improvement of P fertilizer efficiency have led to adoption of specific plant species. Since leguminous crops in general respond better to P fertilizer than cereals, some scientists have proposed the application of P to leguminous crops as the first priority. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the different responses to P fertilizer between the two types of crops, but most of them have not been substantiated. A series of experiments have been conducted by us on different aspects for more than 40years, and this chapter reviews the current investigation status and reports our viewpoints based on results obtained mainly from wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) em. Thell], pea (Pisum sativum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] One reason for the different response to P fertilizer supposes that legumes require more P than nonlegumes. A long-term experiment in a maize–maize–soybean rotation sequence in which maize and soybean were grown in the same season with almost the same duration of growing period showed that the total P uptake by soybean from unit area was similar to that of maize and in some cases uptake by maize was higher than that by soybean. Results of pot and field experiments conducted by us showed that P uptake amount by leguminous crops was not higher than that by cereal crops, and wheat had a higher capacity to use soil P than do pea and vetch. Without application of N fertilizer, P amounts taken up by legumes were equal to or slightly higher than those of nonlegumes, while cereal crops with N application took up much more P than legumes in most cases either with or without application of P fertilizer. In calcareous soil, the P availability in P-containing minerals is roughly equal to that in RPs. Some agricultural scientists have used RPs as substitutes to test the crops' ability of using P from soil. Results show that in addition to the physical and chemical properties of RPs and soil pH, some plant species such as rapeseed (Brassica campestris L. and Brassica napus L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and some legumes possess strong abilities in absorbing P from RPs in acid soils, and good responses of rapeseed to the RPs were also found in calcareous soils. However, there were some debatable issues in these studies: comparisons were made not in the same field but in different locations; excessive rates of RPs were used and the available P in the RPs extracted by 2% citric acid was closely correlated with crops' yield increase; only rapeseed was used for comparison; soils in which yield increase by RPs was several times higher than the control and even higher than superphosphate were particularly unique and had strong responses to calcium carbonate and thus there was no way to separate the effect of P and calcium carbonate contained in RPs; and some results were conflicting. A series of pot and field experiments were conducted by us in two calcareous soils using six crops planted in spring and autumn for both pot and field trials with sufficient N supply. Results showed that crops significantly responded to single superphosphate, while the effect of RPs was seen only at high rates of application. Comprehensive comparisons of the yield increase in absolute amount and in percentage of the control showed that there was almost no difference between legumes and nonlegumes used in our experiments in responses to the RPs. Again, for any crop, the response to RPs was closely related to the citric-acid-soluble P (P₂O₅) in RPs. Since the P concentration in soil solution is very dilute, the movement of P in soil takes place mainly by diffusion, the diffusion coefficient is very low, and the distance moved is very short, and many scientists hold the view that plant roots play a great role in ensuring sufficient P supply to crops and the different responses are attributed to their root characteristics. Our results indicated that wheat had better developed roots, while pea roots had a higher function in supporting shoots. For a single plant, the total root-absorbing and actively absorbing area of pea was larger than that of wheat, but in one unit volume of soil, root dry weight of wheat was 33% higher than that of pea. The root activities in terms of the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) reductive amount and intensity were higher for pea than for wheat. All these root properties could not explain the different responses to P fertilizer between legumes and nonlegumes. Many soil microorganisms are able to transform insoluble forms of P to an accessible soluble form and are regarded as plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM). However, there is no evidence showing their release of P to legumes and nonlegumes, and the very limited knowledge has restrained us from continuing further discussion. Of the hypotheses proposed for explaining the difference of crops in utilizing sparingly soluble P in the soil and their responses to P fertilizer, the most common view is the reduction of rhizosphere pH resulting from the release of protons and organic acids. Our experiments showed that pH in rhizospheric soil was generally one unit lower than that in the bulk soil, but there was no difference in pH between wheat and pea either in rhizospheric or in bulk soil. The available P had the same trend as soil pH. Clearly, the acidification of rhizosphere soil could not differentiate the ability of crops to respond to P fertilizer. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of plant roots was once considered the basis for crops to exchange cations with those held in soil colloids, and crops with a high root CEC could take up more calcium from soil and thus liberate P bound with calcium for crop use. Our study with wheat and pea showed that the root CEC of pea was several times higher than that of wheat in terms of per kilogram dry root or root weight per pot. However, the P uptake amounts by the two crops did not follow the same pattern as the CEC. In relation with root CEC, crop uptake of the calcium was considered a mechanism for P release, and the ratio of CaO to P₂O₅ in plant tissue was proposed as an index of the plant's ability for absorbing P from RPs. However, later researchers have rejected this hypothesis. A series of experiments have shown that the sensitive responses of legumes to P fertilizer are related to their N fixation capacity. These have been evidenced by many facts. It was not always the case that legumes had good responses to P fertilizer; it was true only in a soil deficient in both N and P nutrients. In a soil with sufficient N supply, the difference in P fertilizer response vanished, and the response by cereal crops was even better than by legumes. Addition of N fertilizer to cereal crops significantly increased the P fertilizer effect. In a soil extremely deficient in N and P supply, maize with N addition absorbed almost the same amount of P from the soil as soybean. Without application of N, P uptake by pea was 33% higher than that of wheat, but when fertilized with N there was no difference in the amount of P uptake for the two crops. Also, in a soil deficient in N and P supply, application of N fertilizer to cereal crops and no N or a small amount of N to legumes often resulted in much better responses of cereal crops to P fertilizer. This shows that the sensitivity of legume response to P fertilizer is related to its N fixation. Experiments showed that, before pea acquired the ability to fix N, the biomass increase and P uptake amount were much lower than for wheat, but after reaching the stage for fixing N, pea took up much more P than wheat. This reveals that N fixation increased the amount of P uptake of legumes. Application of N fertilizer to pea to depress N fixation and not adding N fertilizer to wheat resulted in almost the same amount of P uptake by the two crops. In contrast, application of N to wheat led to more P uptake than in the case of pea. The same trend was found for maize and soybean. A layer of soil in which soybean had been grown previously had no nodules and such a soil layer was sampled for conducting a pot experiment with maize and soybean. Maize was given two treatments, i.e., with and without P fertilization, whereas soybean was treated with inoculation and without inoculation on both P treatments. Results showed that in both cases with and without P fertilizer, there was almost no difference in P uptake. However, when soybean was inoculated, the P uptake amount and dry matter increase by P addition were much larger than in maize and soybean that was not inoculated. This clearly indicates the importance of N fixation in leguminous crops to respond to P fertilizers. The responses of cereal crops to P fertilizer are mainly determined by the available P in the soil, and this is true also for leguminous crops. Eight plants grown in five soils in a pot experiment showed that organic matter, total N, total P, soil CaCO₃ contents, and available N in the soil are not related to the P fertilizer effect, but the P available as determined either by the Olsen (available P extracted by 0.5moll⁻¹ NaHCO₃ solution) or the Machigin method (a Russian method of extracting available P by 1% (NH₄)₂CO₃ solution) is closely correlated with the crop response to P fertilizer. Field experiments confirmed these results. Application of N fertilizer is beneficial to P fertilization for cereal crops but detrimental to leguminous crops especially when soil mineral N is abundant. The negative effect of N fertilization on the response of leguminous crops to P fertilizer is mainly caused by the reduction of nodule formation and inhibition of root length, and thereby the elimination of the superiority of leguminous crops, leading to low productivity. Since yields of leguminous crops are lower than cereal crops, the P rate for pea can be reduced at least by 20% as compared to wheat. A series of field experiments have further shown that responses to P fertilizer by legume crops were determined by the soil-available P, as was also the case for cereal crops. In a soil having low available P, P fertilization significantly increased pea yield, and the absolute amount of the increase was almost the same as for wheat, but the percentage of increase was higher than that of wheat due to the low yield in the pea control treatment. At a medium level of soil-available P, pea still had good response to P fertilizer, while wheat had almost no response without application of N fertilizer. Wheat became more and more responsive to P fertilizer with N rate increase, but pea became less responsive. This shows that N was the major constraint limiting wheat response to P fertilizer, and addition of N fertilizer could improve its response to P fertilizer. In a soil with high available P, both pea and wheat had no response to P fertilizer no matter whether N was added or not and no matter what the rate of added N was. Such typical results show that, although leguminous crops need a smaller rate of P fertilizer, their response to soil-available P level is almost the same as for cereal crops. The availability index for the application of P fertilizer to cereal crops could be applicable for leguminous crops as well. To sum up, the different responses of legumes and nonlegumes to P fertilizer are caused neither by the difference of P uptake amount nor by the root characteristics such as root biomass, root surface area, root activity, root exudates, root CEC, and CaO/P₂O₅ ratio in plant tissues, but by the N fixation of leguminous crops. In a soil deficient in both N and P, the application of P fertilizer alone, the leguminous crops' responses to P fertilizer have not been restricted by N limitation, the P fertilizer can fully play its role and therefore the effect of P fertilizer to leguminous crops is much better than that to cereal crops. However, when N supply is sufficient, it is another story for nonleguminous crops. With sufficient N supplies, cereal crops have better responses to P fertilizer than leguminous crops. Responses to P fertilizers are determined by the available soil P levels for both legumes and nonlegumes.</str></doc>

    <str name="abstract">Due to future requirements for more crop production, there will be greater needs to increase yields for crops subjected to water deficits. In recent years, substantial progress has been made with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in understanding the water-deficit limitation on yield using model assessments, physiological investigations, and plant breeding. This knowledge has been applied in developing higher yielding genotypes. This review examines physiological options and genetic advances made with soybean as possible guides for studies with other crops. Three approaches exist for minimizing the negative impact of water deficit on crop production: (1) conserve soil water, (2) access more water, and (3) overcome special water-deficit sensitivities. Water conservation in soybean has been achieved by exploiting a genotype that has limited hydraulic conductance in its leaves. A consequence of this trait is that transpiration rate is limited at times of high vapor pressure deficit resulting in soil water conservation for use later in the season. Acquisition of more water is most likely to be achieved by greater depth of rooting or greater root length density deep in the soil. Although promising genetic variability has been identified, breeding efforts for these rooting traits are still required. A special sensitivity in soybean that results in a major limitation in yield is a decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation rate with only modest soil drying. Germplasm has now been released that results in increased yields due to a capacity for sustained nitrogen fixation with drying soil. This review highlights that soybean investigations combining physiological investigations, simulations studies, and field-based phenotyping of traits have resulted in the identification of genotypes with increased yield potential in water-deficit environments.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a strong determinant of soil quality and crop productivity, especially in the arid and semiarid environments of the tropics. Drought stress, high temperatures reaching up to 45°C for 8–10 weeks in a year, coupled with low biomass productivity are common features of dry agroecosystems. India, with only 2.5% of the world’s geographical area, is a home to 17% of the global population. Population increased from 361 million in 1951 to 1140 million in 2011, more than threefold increase over 50 years. Productivity levels of rainfed dryland crops are far below those of global average. Thus, increasing productivity of rainfed cropping systems is an urgent task to meet the food demand of an ever-increasing population because 57% of the total arable land area of 141Mha is under rainfed farming. Yields of important rainfed production systems in long-term manurial experiments under different climate and soil types show declining trends even with adoption of some recommended management practices (RMPs). Some RMPs include diverse crop rotations with legumes, and integrated nutrient management (INM) involving addition of farmyard manure (FYM), use of groundnut shells (GNS) and other crop residues (CRs), green leaf manuring (GLM), etc. These RMPs have been tested in seven long-term experiments of 13–27 years duration established in diverse soils and agroecoregions. These studies, under the auspices of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA), were conducted under diverse soil and climatic conditions, viz., Anantapur and Bengaluru (Alfisol), Solapur and Indore (Vertisol), Sardar Krushinagar (Entisol), and Varanasi (Inceptisol). Seven rainfed cropping system experiments involved major crops of the region including groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), finger millet (Eleusine coracana), winter sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba), castor (Ricinus communis), soybean (Glycine max), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), lentil (Lens esculenta), and upland rice (Oryza sativa). Diverse nutrient management treatments assessed included cattle manure, green leaf manure, crop residues, and chemical fertilizers. Common soil fertility management treatments across seven experiments were control (no fertilizer or organics), 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDFs), 50% RDF+50% organics, and 100% organics. Maintaining or improving SOC concentration in rainfed dryland agroecosystems is a major agronomic challenge. Yet, the data from long-term experiments show that increasing SOC concentration by C sequestration and stabilization positively affects yields of several crops. Agronomic efficiency of added nutrients and partial factor productivity of crops are maintained or enhanced with INM practices including application of organics in conjunction with chemical fertilizers, but decline with application of only chemical fertilizers because of declining SOC concentration and soil quality with continuous cropping. In comparison with the control, grain yield of all crops are increased significantly with the adoption of INM practices using locally available organic resources. The magnitude of increase in yield (Mgha⁻¹) in respect to control is from: (1)0.78 to 1.03 in groundnut with 50% RDF+FYM4Mgha⁻¹, (2) 0.40 to 1.34 and 0.82 to 3.96 in groundnut and finger millet, respectively, through FYM10Mgha⁻¹+100% NPK in groundnut–finger millet rotation, (3) 0.84 to 3.28 in finger millet through FYM10Mgha⁻¹+100% NPK, (4) 0.61 to 1.19 in winter sorghum through 25kgNha⁻¹ (Leucaena clippings)+25kgNha⁻¹ (urea), (5) 0.43 to 0.81, 0.32 to 0.58 and 0.44 to 0.83 in pear millet, cluster bean, and castor, respectively, through 50% RDN (fertilizer)+50% RDN (FYM), (6) 1.04 to 2.10 and 0.63 to 1.49 in soybean and safflower, respectively, through FYM6Mgha⁻¹+20kgN+13kgPha⁻¹, and (7) 1.08 to 1.95 and 0.48 to 1.04 in rice and lentil, respectively, through 50% N (FYM)+50% RDF treatment. Treatments receiving INM practices also exhibited higher sustainable yield index (SYI) over unfertilized control and sole application of either chemical fertilizers or organic manures. For every Mgha⁻¹ increase in SOC stock in the root zone, there was an increase in grain yield (kgha⁻¹) of 13 for groundnut, 101 for finger millet, 90 for sorghum, 170 for pearl millet, 145 for soybean, 18 for lentil, and 160 for rice. Improved nutrient management practices were identified on the basis of the mean rate of SOC sequestration. The average SOC sequestration rate (kgCha⁻¹year⁻¹) measured with different management treatments were: (1) 570 for 50% RDF+4Mgha⁻¹ GNS, (2) 570–720 for FYM 10Mgha⁻¹+100% NPK, (3) 650 for 25kgNha⁻¹ (sorghum residue)+25kgN (Leucaena clippings), (4) 240 for 50% RDN (fertilizer)+50% RDN (FYM), (5) 790 for FYM6Mgha⁻¹+20kgN+13kg P, and (6) 320 for 100% organic (FYM). The critical level of C input requirements for maintaining SOC at the antecedent level ranged from 1 to 3.5MgCha⁻¹ year⁻¹ and differed among soil type and production system. The critical level of C input was higher in soybean system and lower in winter sorghum system and increased with increase in mean annual temperature from humid to semiarid to arid ecosystems. Thus, RMPs based on locally available organic resources are a win–win situation for improving productivity and SOC sequestration, thus advancing food security and improving the environment.</str></doc>

    <str name="abstract">We examined intraguild predation of Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) in breeder piles by the soil-dwelling predators, Stratiolaelaps miles (Berlese) (Laelapidae) and Atheta coriaria (Kraatz) (Staphylinidae) in a greenhouse microcosm study. Each microcosm contained a soybean plant (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) and a N. cucumeris breeder pile alone, a N. cucumeris breeder pile with either S. miles mites or A. coriaria, or a N. cucumeris breeder pile with both S. miles and A. coriaria. We measured numbers of N. cucumeris, S. miles, A. coriaria, and their shared prey: Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank) (Acaridae) mold mites and incident thrips (Thripidae: Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips sp.). Peak populations of N. cucumeris in breeder piles and soybean canopies lacking S. miles and/or A. coriaria predators were fourfold greater than when other predators were present. We observed more N. cucumeris mites in plant canopies in microcosms where other predators were absent. S. miles had a significant negative impact on A. coriaria and A. coriaria had numerical negative impacts on S. miles. There were fewer T. putrescentiae mold mites in microcosms containing A. coriaria (⩽1049.28±301.72) compared with other treatments (⩾2428.16±452.24) overall. We observed fivefold more incident thrips in microcosms containing all three predators compared with N. cucumeris breeder pile alone and N. cucumeris breeder pile with either of the other predators. Our results demonstrate that greenhouses seeking to biologically manage thrips should either utilize N. cucumeris alone or utilize alternative N. cucumeris release strategies –i.e. hanging sachets or repeated foliar applications.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Agriculture faces unique challenges as increasing world population places unprecedented demands on food, feed, and energy resources. In an effort to become more efficient and sustainable, marginal land, including regulatory brownfields prohibited for food consumption purposes could be utilized for bioenergy crop production. In 2006–2008, we evaluated soybean (Glycine Max (L.) Merr.), canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to determine crop suitability for bioenergy production on a regulatory brownfield site. Sites selected for the study included a remediated brownfield site in Rose Township, Oakland County, and a historically cropped agricultural site at East Lansing, Ingham County, serving as the control. Comparisons of biofuel quality components were conducted. The total oil yield of oilseed crops was not significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between locations. Concentrations of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) fatty acids differed by location, yet oleic acid concentrations, optimal for quality biodiesel production, were not significantly different across all oilseed crops. Total crystalline cellulose levels from switchgrass were higher at the agricultural land site compared to the brownfield site in 2007 yielding 16% more crystalline cellulose; but there were no differences between locations in 2008. Detectable levels of PCB's were found in soils at the brownfield site; however, transfer to grain or biomass was not detected. Results suggest that brownfield sites have the potential to produce feedstock of suitable quality for conversion to liquid transportation fuels.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Fertilization is one of the agronomic practices that generates the highest environmental burdens in energy crops. However, this practice is essential, since its omission could entail long term processes of soil degradation, endangering the environmental sustainability of agricultural systems. In most of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of energy crops found in the scientific literature, the inputs and outputs of nutrients are not calculated and the environmental impacts of nutrient loss are ignored as well. In this paper, a methodological approach to calculate the balance of nutrients that occurs during annual crop production in the context of the Life Cycle Inventory phase of LCA is proposed and applied to two study cases of energy crops: rapeseed (Brassica napus) in Cádiz, Spain, and soybean (Glycine max) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results show that when rational fertilization is carried out, rapeseed fertilization in Spain generates more severe environmental impacts than soybean in the Argentinean Pampas when 1 ha of crop per year is used as the functional unit.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Time of day has been observed to affect flaming efficacy. The basis for the differential plant response is not well understood; however, daily variation in leaf relative water content (RWC) is thought to contribute to the response. Leaf RWC is the ratio of the amount of water in the leaf tissue compared to when fully turgid. To determine the influence of leaf RWC in plant response to propane flaming, greenhouse experiments were conducted during April and repeated in September of 2009. Two crops [4-leaf maize (Zea mays) and second trifoliate soybean (Glycine max)] and two weed species [5-leaf velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) and 6-leaf green foxtail (Setaria viridis)] were flamed with four propane doses of 0, 29, 43 and 87 kg ha⁻¹ at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h after sunrise-HAS. Leaf RWC was measured before treatment application. Flaming treatment was conducted utilizing a hand flamer with one VT 2–23 C vapor phase burner positioned 20 cm above soil surface and angled horizontally at 30°. The propane pressure was 120 kPa and the application speeds were 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 km h⁻¹. The plant responses evaluated were plant injury and fresh weight at 7 days after treatment (DAT). All plant species were more susceptible to flaming during the afternoon when they had lower leaf RWC at 8 HAS; however, the response of these plants did not differ with the plants flamed at 12 HAS. Green foxtail flamed at 87 kg ha⁻¹ at 0, 8 and 12 HAS had injury of 62, 76 and 82%, respectively. The same response was observed in velvetleaf which had 80% injury when flamed with 87 kg ha⁻¹ at 0 HAS and 93% injury when flamed at 12 HAS with the same propane dose at 7 DAT. Similar trends occurred for maize and soybean suggesting that leaf RWC could be one of the factors affecting plant response to flaming. Practical implication is that flaming operation should be conducted in the afternoon in order to improve efficacy of weed control and reduce propane consumption rate.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Predicting carbon (C) mineralization of crop residues returned to soils is important for forecasting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere and soil nitrogen (N) availability. In this study, a laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate C mineralization of residues of soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays), and their mixture placed on the soil surface and incorporated into the soils in a Mollisol in northeast China. Both the residue type and placement significantly affected C and N mineralization, while no significant interactions between them were observed on cumulative C mineralization. The soybean residue had a higher decomposition rate than the maize residue regardless of their placements; decomposition rates for both soybean and maize residues placed on the soil surface were higher than those of the same residues incorporated into the soils. Moreover, non-additive effects on the contribution of each residue type to C mineralization of the residue mixture were not observed. Our results suggest that crop residue with a low N concentration and a high C/N ratio (such as maize) can be incorporated into soils to immobilize N and decrease CO2 emissions in comparison with crop residue placed on the soil surface.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Saponins are a diverse group of plant secondary metabolites with a wide array of activities, as well as a significant role in nutrition and health. Saponins occur as multi-component mixtures of compounds with very similar polarities. Soysaponins are a special group of saponins. These represent the main source of saponins in Glycine max (soybeans, Fabaceae). In a study of the chemical profiling of plants, to investigate the possible misidentification and authentication of dietary supplements, the hydro-alcoholic extract of G. max was investigated. Three new saponins, designated as soysaponins M1 (1), M2 (2) and M3 (3) along with seven known soysaponins (4–10) were isolated by normal and reverse phase liquid chromatography. All compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques including 2D NMR spectroscopy.</str>

    <str name="abstract">A reliable and fast detection of important food plants, such as maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.) is of particular interest for food authenticity and safety assessment. In this study, the novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for the rapid qualitative detection of soybean, maize and wheat. To this purpose, new soybean-specific and maize-specific PCR primers were designed. Their specificity was assayed by uniplex PCRs with different plant species, namely maize, soybean, wheat, oats (Avena sativa), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L). Gel electrophoresis of the amplification products demonstrated high specificity of both primer pairs for identification of relevant species. Subsequently, based on the developed DNA markers, the species-specific triplex PCR targeting maize invertase gene, soybean lectin gene and wheat low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit was developed and optimized for simultaneous identification of these three plant species. The developed PCR method enables specific, effective and rapid detection of maize, wheat and soybean and may be used for food analysis.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The consumption of sprouts, common in Asia, has been growing in western countries, once they are a natural healthy food and considered as a valuable dietary supplement. Comparing with their mature counterparts, sprouts are usually richer in health-promoting phytochemicals. So, the nutritional composition and the biological potential of widely consumed sprouts of three species – Glycine max (L.) Merr., Vigna radiata L. and Medicago sativa L. – were compared for the first time. Phenolic compounds and phytosterols were analyzed by HPLC–DAD and organic acids by HPLC–UV. The volatile profile was determined by HS-SPME/GC–IT/MS. Fourteen phenolic compounds (including four isoflavones), three sterols one triterpene, sixteen fatty acids, seven organic acids and thirty volatile compounds were determined. The antioxidant activity was assessed against DPPH•, superoxide and nitric oxide radicals. G. max sprouts were the most active against DPPH• (IC50=1.337mg/mL), while those of M. sativa were the most effective against superoxide and nitric oxide radicals (IC50=67μg/mL and IC50=426μg/mL, respectively). Data provide evidence of great similarities between G. max and M. sativa sprouts, both being rich in phenolic compounds, fatty acids and volatiles, and exhibiting better antioxidant activity. On the other hand, V. radiata showed higher amounts of sterols, triterpenes and organic acids. In this study it was found that the sprouts are a good source of bioactive compounds in our diet with health-promoting antioxidants.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Among the mineral elements required by humans, iron (Fe) is the most common cause of nutritional deficiencies, particularly anaemia. Legume plants are extremely important in the world's diet and they are major sources of mineral nutrients. However, when these plant foods are grown in calcareous soil, their production is severely affected by Fe deficiency chlorosis (IDC), and when less Fe is available for absorption, less amount of this element will be available for accumulation in the edible plant parts. As Fe plays critical roles in photosynthesis and respiration, when lacking this element, plants develop chlorosis and their growth is drastically reduced. IDC morphological symptoms were monitored in soybean (Glycine max), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the model crop barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). When compared to the other two legumes, G. max presented lower Fe-reduction rates and severe chlorosis, associated with lower SPAD values. Transcriptome analysis was performed in roots of the three species when grown in Fe deficiency and Fe sufficiency, and 114,723 annotated genes were obtained for all samples. Four IDC-related genes were up-regulated in common by the three species and can be considered key players involved in the IDC response, namely, metal ligands, transferases, zinc ion binding and metal ion binding genes. With regards to the genes most highly expressed under iron deficiency individually by each species, we found that the most highly expressed genes were a defensin in P. vulgaris, a phosphatase in M. truncatula and a zinc ion binding gene in G. max.</str>

    <str name="abstract">EvaGreen multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (EMRT-PCR) was designed for an assay that can unite the advantages of real-time PCR and multiplex PCR to recognize animal genes more quickly in sausages. EMRT-PCR based on melting temperatures discrimination by using EvaGreen fluorescence dye was developed for the analysis of beef and soybean in sausages. The method combines the use of bovine (Bos taurus) and soybean (Glycine max) specific primers that amplify small fragments (bovine; 271bp and soybean; 100bp) of the mitochondrial bovine ATPase8 subunit and lectin genes, respectively. Appropriate mixtures of beef and soybean sausage DNA were used to develop the assay. Gene products of beef (bovine) and soybean were represented in two melting peaks generated simultaneously at 82°C and 86°C, respectively. Analysis of the reference sausages showed that the detection limit of the assay was 0.003% for beef and 0.001% for soybean species. Multiplex results obtained with one of the multiplex polymerase mix linked extremely well with the uniplex reference. The aim of the study was to design a fast, sensitive, specific and accurate multiplex real-time PCR assay by using EvaGreen fluorescence dye that is cost-effective than double labeled probes to detect the beef and soybean species in sausages simultaneously.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The ecology of parasitoids is strongly influenced by their host plant species. Parasitoid fitness can be affected by a variety of plant traits that could promote phenotypic differentiation among populations of parasitoids. Generalist parasitoids are expected to be more affected by plant traits (e.g., plant defensive traits) than specialist parasitoids. Data are presented on phenotypic differences of two braconid parasitoid wasps ovipositing on the same insect host species on two different host plant species. Adult mass, adult longevity, and percent parasitism are compared for the generalist parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris Cresson and the specialist parasitoid Aleiodes nolophanae Ashmead (both Hymenoptera: Braconidae) emerging from green cloverworms, Hypena scabra Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), feeding on two host plant species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) (both Fabaceae), at three locations. Specialist wasps that parasitized the green cloverworm on alfalfa had a significantly larger mass than the ones that parasitized the green cloverworm on soybean at the three study sites. Generalist wasps that parasitized green cloverworms on alfalfa had a larger mass than wasps parasitizing green cloverworms on soybean only at one of the study sites (i.e., Prince George's County, MD, USA). Similarly, both specialist and generalist wasps lived longer when parasitizing green cloverworms on alfalfa than when parasitizing them on soybean at only one of the study sites (i.e., Prince George's County). In Prince George's County, percent parasitism on alfalfa by the specialist parasitoid was higher than on soybean for three consecutive years and percent parasitism by the generalist parasitoid was the same on alfalfa and soybean every year. Thus, phenotypic differences among populations associated with different host plant species vary geographically (i.e., parasitoid phenotype associated with different host plant species differ at some sites while it is the same at other sites). The implications of geographic variation for biological control are discussed.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean (Glycine max) 7S β-conglycinin is a seed storage protein consisting of homo- and hetero-trimers of three subunits, namely α (∼67kDa), α′ (∼71kDa), and β (∼50kDa), non-covalently associated. The N-glycans released from the whole β-conglycinin have been already characterized by ¹H NMR some decades ago. Nevertheless, the actual glycosylation of the potential sites and the glycoforms of the individual subunits have not been specifically investigated so far. In this study, up-to-date chromatographic, electrophoretic and mass spectrometric strategies have been combined to achieve the structural characterization of the glycoforms of the three individual β-conglycinin subunits. Glycosylation sites were assigned by analyzing the tryptic glycopeptides of the isolated subunits. Underivatized N-glycans were purified with a two-step clean-up, consisting in sequential reversed-phase and activated porous graphitized carbon micro-chromatography, and profiled by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).</str>

    <str name="abstract">Plant foliar uptake and translocation is an important pathway for the migration of radiocesium to the human diet. This study reports the effects of accompanying anions (3NO−, 4SO2−, 3CO2−, and I-) on cesium retention and translocation. An experiment to simulate cesium retention and translocation was conducted in a greenhouse by applying droplets of stable cesium solutions to the upper surface of four soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] trifoliate leaves. The average percentages of cesium retention with the accompanying anions 3NO−, 4SO2−, 3CO2−, and I- on the leaves were 7.2, 21.5, 49.3, and 10.2%, respectively. Retention values of the four treatments were stable during the 3-day exposure period, indicating that cesium could be absorbed and penetrate the cuticle quickly once it was dissolved. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed that particles containing cesium remained on the leaf surfaces after washing. Also, nano-sized particles containing cesium were observed inside the leaf tissues. Cesium concentrations in the uncontaminated leaves, pods, stems, and roots increased during the study period indicating cesium redistribution from the contaminated leaves.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) play an essential role on the increased tolerance against heat stress by regulating the expression of heat-responsive genes. In this study, a genome-wide analysis was performed to identify all of the soybean (Glycine max) GmHsf genes based on the latest soybean genome sequence. Chromosomal location, protein domain, motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of 26 non-redundant GmHsf genes were analyzed compared with AtHsfs (Arabidopsis thaliana Hsfs). According to their structural features, the predicted members were divided into the previously defined classes A–C, as described for AtHsfs. Transcript levels and subcellular localization of five GmHsfs responsive to abiotic stresses were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. These results provide a fundamental clue for understanding the complexity of the soybean GmHsf gene family and cloning the functional genes in future studies.</str>

    <str name="abstract">In plants, proteins of the β-substituted alanine synthase (BSAS) enzyme family perform a diverse range of reactions, including formation of cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide, detoxification of cyanide by its addition to cysteine, the breakdown of cysteine into pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide, and the synthesis of S-sulfocysteine. With the completed genome sequence of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Williams 82), the functional diversity of the BSAS in this highly duplicated plant species was examined to determine whether soybean BSAS enzymes catalyze the various reactions connected to cysteine metabolism. The 16 soybean BSAS can be grouped into clades that are similar to those observed in Arabidopsis. Biochemical analysis of soybean BSAS proteins demonstrate that enzymes of clades I and III function as O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases for cysteine synthesis, clade II encodes cysteine desulfhydrase activity, and that clade V proteins function as β-cyanoalanine synthase for cyanide detoxification. Although clade IV is similar to Arabidopsis S-sulfocysteine synthase, this activity was not detected in the soybean homolog. Overall, our results show that bioinformatics approach provides a useful method to assess the biochemical properties of BSAS enzymes in plant species.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soil salinization is a global issue that hampers agricultural production. Chloride is one of the prominent anions on saline land that cause toxicity to the plant. We previously identified the GmCLC1 gene from soybean (Glycine max) that encodes a putative tonoplast-localized chloride transporter. In this study, using electrophysiological analysis, we demonstrated the chloride transport function of GmCLC1. Interestingly, this chloride transport activity is pH dependent, suggesting that GmCLC1 is probably a chloride/proton antiporter. When the cDNA of GmCLC1 was expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells under the control of a constitutive promoter, the protective effect against salinity stress in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells was also found to be pH sensitive. In the native host soybean, the expression of GmCLC1 gene is regulated by pH. All these findings support the notion that the function of GmCLC1 is regulated by pH.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Nitrogen fixation of terrestrial legumes is strongly and rapidly diminished under flooding. Although recovery is possible with the formation of aerenchyma, information is scarce regarding recovery after draining following short-term flooding, before the appearance of morphological adaptations. This study used soybean (Glycine max) plants nodulated with Bradyrhizobium elkanii to determine xylem sap glutamine as an indication of nitrogen fixation activity during recovery from different periods of flooding. Xylem glutamine levels showed rapid recovery (within 90min) following periods of flooding up to 4h. Recovery was progressively slower after longer periods of flooding. After 48h flooding very little recovery could be observed within the first 120min after draining but recovery was possible within 48h. Consistent with the changes in xylem glutamine, direct measurements of apparent nitrogenase activity carried out immediately on draining revealed rapid recovery after flooding for 1h and slow recovery following 48h of flooding. In the latter case, nitrogenase activity largely recovered 24h after draining. Experiments with 15N2 incorporation into amino acids exported in the xylem sap revealed that glutamine was by far the most highly labelled amino acid in sap collected over the first 30min of exposure to the isotope. This is conclusive evidence that xylem sap glutamine is an immediate product of N2 fixation and export. The changes in xylem sap glutamine seen on flooding (decline) and after draining (recovery) can therefore be attributed to changes in nitrogenase activity. The data show that xylem sap glutamine is a useful means for assessing changes in nitrogenase activity, especially when the root system is submersed in water and activity cannot be measured directly.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Germination is a complex process, highly dependent on various environmental factors, including temperature and water availability. Germinating soybean seeds are especially vulnerable to unfavorable environmental conditions and exposure to long-term abiotic stresses may result in diminishing much of the yield and most importantly – restrained germination. In the present study, a proteomic approach was employed to analyze influence of cold and osmotic stress on roots of germinated soybean (Glycine max, L.) seeds. Seeds were germinating under continuous conditions of cold stress (+10°C/H2O), osmotic stress (+25°C/−0.2MPa) as well as cold and osmotic stress combined (+10°C/−0.2MPa). Proteome maps established for control samples and stress-treated samples displayed 1272 CBB-stained spots. A total of 59 proteins, present in both control and stress-treated samples and showing significant differences in volume, were identified with LC/nanoESI-MS. Identified proteins divided into functional categories, revealed 9 proteins involved in plant defense, 8 proteins responsible for plant destination and storage and 10 proteins involved in various tracks of carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, a number of proteins were assigned to electron transport, range of metabolic pathways, secondary metabolism, protein synthesis, embryogenesis and development, signal transduction, cellular transport, translocation and storage. By analyzing differences in expression patterns, it was possible to trace the soybean response to long-term abiotic stress as well as to distinguish similarities and differences between response to cold and osmotic stress.</str>

    <str name="abstract">In the present study, the expression of fourteen genes involved in various signal transduction pathways was examined in young soybean (Glycine max) seedlings exposed to cadmium at two concentrations (10mgL−1 and 25mgL−1) for short time periods (3, 6 and 24h). The results show that cadmium causes induction of genes encoding proteins involved in ethylene and polyamines metabolism, nitric oxide generation, MAPK cascades and regulation of other genes’ expression. The bioinformatic analysis of promoter sequences of Cd-inducible genes revealed that their promoters possess several regulative motifs associated with the plant response to stress factors and abscisic acid and ethylene signaling. The involvement of ethylene in the response of soybean seedlings to cadmium stress was further confirmed by the real-time analysis of ethylene production during 24h of CdCl2 treatment. The role of the described signaling elements in transduction of the cadmium signal in young soybean seedlings is discussed.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean (Glycine max) is often being cultivated in soils with moderate to high arsenic (As) concentrations or under irrigation with As contaminated groundwater. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of As on soybean germination, development and nodulation in soybean-Bradyrhizobium japonicum E109 symbiosis, as a first-step approach to evaluate the impact of As on soybean production. Semi-hydroponic assays were conducted using soybean seedlings inoculated and non-inoculated with B. japonicum E109 and treated with arsenate or arsenite. Soybean germination and development, at early stage of growth, were significantly reduced from 10 μM arsenate or arsenite. This also was seen for soybean seedlings inoculated with B. japonicum mainly with arsenite where, in addition, the number of effective nodules was reduced, despite that the microorganism tolerated the metalloid. This minor nodulation could be due to a reduced motility (swarming and swimming) of the microorganism in presence of As. Arsenic concentration in roots was about 250-times higher than in shoots. Transference coefficient values indicated that As translocation to aerial parts was low and As accumulated mainly in roots, without significant differences between inoculated and non-inoculated plants. The presence of As restricted soybean–B. japonicum symbiosis and hence, the efficiency of most used commercial inoculants for soybean. Thus, water and/or soils containing As would negatively impact on soybean production, even in plants inoculated with B. japonicum E109.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Although nitrate (NO3−) but not ammonium (NH4+) improves plant tolerance to oxygen deficiency, the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are just beginning to be understood. By using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we investigated the metabolic fate of 15NO3− and 15NH4+ in soybean plants (Glycine max L. Merril cv. IAC-23) subjected to root hypoxia. This stress reduced the uptake of 15NO3− and 15NH4+ from the medium and decreased the overall assimilation of these nitrogen sources into amino acids in roots and leaves. Root 15NO3− assimilation was more affected by hypoxia than that of 15NH4+, resulting in enhanced nitrite and nitric oxide release in the solution. However, 15NO3− was translocated in substantial amounts by xylem sap and considerable 15NO3− assimilation into amino acids also occurred in the leaves, both under hypoxia and normoxia. By contrast, 15NH4+ assimilation occurred predominantly in roots, resulting in accumulation of mainly 15N–alanine in this tissue during hypoxia. Analysis of lactate levels suggested higher fermentation in roots from NH4+-treated plants compared to the NO3− treatment. Thus, foliar NO3− assimilation may be relevant to plant tolerance to oxygen deficiency, since it would economize energy expenditure by hypoxic roots. Additionally, the involvement of nitric oxide synthesis from nitrite in the beneficial effect of NO3− is discussed.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean (Glycine max) is a relatively cold intolerant plant. In most stress tolerant plants the responsive expression of dehydrin proteins in vegetative tissues can be a significant contributor to protection against environmental stresses. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of dehydrins in various organs and the cold-responses of dehydrin genes in vegetative tissues of soybean. Examination of the soybean genome indicated the presence of genes encoding ten distinct dehydrins. Levels of dehydrin proteins were probed with several antibodies specific to dehydrins or to the signature K-sequence. A single vegetatively expressed dehydrin protein was detected and the levels were insignificantly altered in response to cold, drought, or salt stress, nor was the transcript responsive to ABA. This SK2-type, acidic dehydrin family member (GmERD14) was purified, identified by mass spectroscopy, and shown to be in vivo phosphorylated; indicating characteristics similar to other known acidic dehydrins. The lack of cold stress-regulated acidic dehydrin expression may contribute to the inability of soybean to cold acclimate. While transcripts for all ten dehydrins could be detected in various tissues, only three accumulated to significant levels in vegetative tissues (two of the KS type and one of SK2 type). One of these transcripts, a KS dehydrin, was accumulated following cold treatments. The accumulation of the KS dehydrin was also responsive to exogenous ABA.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Lectins, proteins which recognize selectively carbohydrates, have been used as affinity chromatography to purify glycoproteins. Cratylia mollis seed lectin (Cramoll 1,4), of mannose/glucose binding class, immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B, was used as affinity matrix. This paper describes the purification by Cramoll 1,4-Sepharose matrix, and characterization of an anti-platelet and anticoagulant soybean (Glycine max) protein, ApcSP, and its in vitro platelet antiaggregation and anticoagulant activities. SDS-PAGE of ApcSP purified under reducing condition revealed a single glycosilated band of 51kDa. The N-terminal 10-residue sequence of ApcSP is EGQFGPMIQS, distinct to other soybean seed proteins, such as peroxidase, lectin, 2S albumin and trypsin inhibitor. Deconvolution of CD spectrum indicated 35% α-helix, 17% β-strand, 22% turn and 26% unordered structure; ApcSP fluorescence spectrum showed a maximum emission around 339nm. The hemostatic parameters revealed inhibition of collagen (p&lt;0.001), thrombin (p&lt;0.05) and ADP (p&lt;0.001)-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of ApcSP (2μM), in relation to positive control. The soy protein prolonged the blood coagulation time (activated partial thromboplastin time, more affected, and prothrombin time). The results indicated that immobilized Cramoll 1,4 lectin has the potential to isolate soybean glycoproteins and ApcSP may be important for anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant therapy.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Trypsin inhibitor was extracted from the seed flour of soybean (SB; Glycine max), mung bean (MB; Vigna radiata), cowpea bean (CP; Vigna unguiculata) and adzuki bean (AB; Vigna angularis) using 0.15M NaCl, followed by heat precipitation at 70°C. The extract from SB showed the highest specific trypsin inhibitory activity, followed by those from MB, CP and AB, respectively. Based on inhibitory activity staining, molecular weights (MWs) of trypsin inhibitor from SB, MB, CP and AB were 20.1, 14, 10 and 13kDa, respectively. The SB extract powder (SBEP) containing trypsin inhibitor in the range of 10–100TIU/g effectively prevented the degradation of γ-, β- and α-chains of collagenolytic proteins of leatherjacket skin subjected to incubation at 50°C for 30min. The impact of SBEP on the extraction yield, physical and functional properties of gelatin from leatherjacket skin was investigated. The gelatin extracted in the presence of SBEP contained α₁ and α₂ chains as the predominant components with some degradation peptides. FTIR spectra indicated the significant loss of molecular order of triple helix and higher degradation was found in gelatin extracted in the absence of SBEP. Gelatin extracted in the presence of SBEP had the higher gel strength (232.8–268.5g) than that extracted in the absence of SBEP (90.4g). Higher foam stability (FS) but lower emulsion stability index (ESI) was observed in the former. Therefore, the addition of SBEP effectively prevented the degradation of gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket, thereby yielding the gelatin with improved gel strength and foam stability.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Increased phosphorus (P) uptake during intercropping has been demonstrated previously between specific crop species, e.g. cereal–legumes, in P deficient alkaline or neutral soils. The evidence is less strong in P deficient acidic soils. To assess the interspecific effects of acidic soils on P uptake, and to determine the biochemical mechanisms involved, a field experiment with maize-based (Zea mays) intercropping was conducted with the legumes chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max), as well as the cereal wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively, in subtropical acidic soils of Southern China. The land equivalent ratio (LER) values (on an average of 1.20 and 1.07 for maize–chickpea and maize–soybean, respectively; and from 0.85 to 1.08 on average for maize–wheat after P fertilization) indicated that the interspecific stimulation of P uptake may be a general phenomenon i.e. controlled by soil P availability rather than crop species or soil type. Rhizosphere soil pH increased compared to that of non-rhizosphere even following the addition of the acidic calcium superphosphate (on an average of 0.16–0.56 pH units), suggesting rhizosphere acidification due to intercropping could not be the cause of increased P uptake in acid soils, unlike in alkaline or calcareous soils. The microbial phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) profiles varied with both intercropping species and soil P status, indicating a selective enrichment of competent species (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, and probably P solubilizing microorganisms) that may be responsible for increased P uptake during intercropping. The results suggest that root contact modified the microbial communities and the dominant microbial species in the intercropped rhizosphere, thereby contributing to increased P uptake during intercropping in acidic soils.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Drying–wetting cycles influence both soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and rhizosphere processes. Rhizosphere processes also affect SOM decomposition through rhizosphere priming. However, little is known about how drying–wetting cycles regulate SOM decomposition with rhizosphere priming, because most previous studies incubated root-free soils and omitted the rhizosphere effect. To investigate the effect of drying–wetting cycles on SOM decomposition in the presence of plants, we grew sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and soybean (Glycine max) in a sandy loam soil under the treatments of either constant moisture or 12 drying–wetting cycles, and used a continuous 13C-labeling method to partition soil respiration into rhizosphere respiration and SOM decomposition. We found that compared to the constantly-moist treatment, the severe drying–wetting cycles in soils planted with sunflower significantly reduced shoot biomass (32%), root biomass (52%), rhizosphere respiration (29%), and SOM decomposition (22%), while the moderate drying–wetting cycles in soils planted with soybean did not significantly affect these variables. Moreover, SOM decomposition rates in the planted treatment subjected to constantly-moist or drying–wetting conditions were significantly higher compared with the constantly-moist unplanted treatment, indicating a positive rhizosphere priming effect under both soil moisture regimes. However, drying–wetting reduced the rhizosphere priming of sunflower (69% versus 33%) likely due to lower plant biomass and rhizodeposition, but produced similar rhizosphere priming of soybean (82% versus 85%). Overall, drying–wetting cycles significantly modulated rhizosphere respiration and SOM decomposition, with the magnitude depending on soil drying intensity and plant growth performance.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Introgression lines are important genetic materials for genetics study and breeding. Development of those lines involves cross and backcross processes between recipient and donor parents. The population size of BC₁F₁ is a critical parameter for fully covering donor genome and successfully obtaining desired introgression lines. However, the minimum sufficient number of BC₁F₁ plants is unknown for each species and cannot be obtained experimentally. A computer program was developed by simulating the recombination process during meiosis to define the ideal BC₁F₁ population size. The reliability of the program was confirmed by mathematics and experimental data. Three factors including linkage group number, linkage group length, and gene density were analyzed, and all of them had positive relation with the size of BC₁F₁ population. The population size increased from 6.06 to 9.49 when the linkage number increased from 5 to 40. The population size was 7.14 when the linkage group length was 80 cM, while it became 8.64 when the length was 200 cM. The population size was 7.65 with the density of 20 cM per gene and 8.22 with 10 cM per gene. The BC₁F₁ population sizes of rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) were predicted to be 12, 13, 14–15, and 13, respectively, by the program with 95% confidential level.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The objective of this study was to understand the genetic and allelomorphic relationships among different soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) cultivars with resistance to Soybean mosaic virus (SMV). Twelve resistant (R) soybean cultivars were crossed with a susceptible (S) cultivar (Nannong 1138-2, NY30, NY185, 86-4, or 8101) to determine the inheritance of resistance to SMV strain SC4 or SC8, which were predominant in the Huang-Huai-Hai Rivers Region and Yangtze Valley in China. The R parents were also crossed with each other for allelic analysis of resistance genes from different sources. The results indicated that Ji LD42, Xudou 1, and Yuejin 4 and Qihuang 1, Zhongzuo 229, and NY58 carried a dominant resistance gene for SMV strains SC4 and SC8, respectively, whereas Kefeng 1, PI 96983, Jinda 74, Fendou 56, Dabaima, and Qihuang 22 carried single dominant resistance gene for both SC4 and SC8. The allelism test of the resistance genes to SC4 showed that the resistance genes between Dabaima and Fendou 56, Kefeng 1, and Qihuang 1, between Ji LD42 and Fendou 56, and between Jinda 74 and Zhongzuo 229 were not at the same loci. The study of resistance of F₂ plants and F₂:₃ families to SC8 indicated that the single dominant resistance genes in Jinda 74 and Fendou 56 shared a common locus or two closely loci. The resistance genes between Qihuang 1 and Kefeng 1 and between Dabaima and Fendou 56 were not at the same locus for SC8. These results are useful to understand the genetic and allelomorphic relationships among various sources of resistance.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Sustainable agricultural production requires prudent management backed by reliable information that accurately elucidates the complex relationships between land management practices and soil quality trends. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of management on soil properties acquired at different depths, and yields, at five different field sites within Ohio, USA. The principal management systems considered were no till with or without manure and cover crops, natural vegetation (NV) or forest, and conventional tillage (CT) defined as farms with surface residue cover (&lt;30 %). Analyses of variance (ANOVA), correlation analyses, stepwise regression, and the principal component analyses (PCA) were used to elucidate and model the link between four different management practices and the soil physical and chemical properties. The ANOVA results indicate that the available water capacity and electrical conductivity (EC) were the major variables affected by management. In contrast, soil pH, bulk density (ρ b), porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were invariable with management, yet only pH and EC did not significantly vary with the interaction of soil type and management effects. In comparison, the PCA results suggest that SOC, TN, porosity, ρ b, and EC were the major determining factors controlling yield variability. Interestingly, the derived models revealed that the highest yields, notably 10 and 2.7 Mg ha⁻¹ for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) occurred in soils under CT management. Quantifying the nexus between soil properties and management choices as demonstrated in this study, can provide critical insight for sustainable agricultural production.</str>

    <str name="abstract">KEY MESSAGE : A platform of gene silencing by amiRNA had been established in fertile transgenic soybean. We demonstrated that knockdown of storage protein shifted the distribution of nitrogen sources in soybean seeds. Artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) were designed using the precursor sequence of the endogenous soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) miRNA gma-miR159a and expressed in transgenic soybean plants to suppress the biosynthesis of 7S globulin, which is one of the major storage proteins. Seed-specific expression of these amiRNAs (amiR-7S) resulted in a strong suppression of 7S globulin subunit genes and decreased accumulation of the 7S globulin subunits in seeds. Thus, the results demonstrate that a platform for gene silencing by amiRNA was first developed in fertile transgenic soybean plants. There was no difference in nitrogen, carbon, and lipid contents between amiR-7S and control seeds. Four protein fractions were collected from defatted mature seeds on the basis of solubility at different pH to examine the distribution of nitrogen sources and compensatory effects. In the whey and lipophilic fractions, nitrogen content was similar in amiR-7S and control seeds. Nitrogen content was significantly decreased in the major soluble protein fraction and increased in the residual fraction (okara) of the amiR-7S seeds. Amino acid analysis revealed that increased nitrogen compounds in okara were proteins or peptides rather than free amino acids. Our study indicates that the decrease in 7S globulin subunits shifts the distribution of nitrogen sources to okara in transgenic soybean seeds.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Management inputs that maximize economic return from the early soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production system (ESPS) in the midsouthern USA have not been evaluated fully. Field studies were conducted at Stoneville, MS (33°26′ N lat) to determine effect of weed management on yield and net return from maturity group (MG) IV and MG V cultivars grown in the ESPS in narrow rows (NRs; 50-cm width) and wide rows (WRs; 100-cm width) in nonirrigated (NI) and irrigated (IRR) environments. Use of NRs vs. WRs resulted in less weed cover at soybean maturity, but this was associated with greater weed management costs in NRs. In NI, choice of MG for ESPS plantings and choice of row width for MG V cultivars was arbitrary, but the MG IV cultivar did best in NR. Use of both pre-emergent (PRE) and postemergent (POST) broadleaf weed management in both NRs and WRs resulted in lower net returns. In IRR, NRs outyielded WRs, the MG IV cultivar yield equaled or exceeded the MG V yield in NRs, and the MG V cultivar outyielded the MG IV cultivar in WRs in both years. Differences in net returns followed yield differences. Use of POST-only broadleaf and grass weed management resulted in the highest net returns across the 2 yr. Thus, a MG IV cultivar planted in NRs with POST weed management appears to be the most profitable option in IRR-ESPS plantings. If WRs are required for management reasons in the ESPS, a MG V cultivar should be used.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and CROPGRO-Soybean simulate soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] growth, development, and yield. The models require calibration for soybean grown in the specific environmental conditions of the central Great Plains before any long-term assessments can be made of dryland soybean yield potential under the highly variable precipitation patterns of this area. The objective of this study was to calibrate and test RZWQM and CROPGRO-Soybean for soybean growth, yield, and water use under a range of water stress conditions normally encountered by dryland production systems in the central Great Plains. Data from five experiments, each with four levels of water availability (20 data sets), were used to evaluate leaf area, plant height, aboveground biomass, evapotranspiration (ET), soil water extraction, and yield of soybean. Data from one water level of one experiment was used to calibrate the models, and the other 19 data sets were used as evaluation data sets. Both models correctly predicted the time course of volumetric water content, leaf area development, and plant and height biomass increase although RZWQM more accurately simulated water extraction in the lower soil profile. The decline in ET that is a result of decreased water availability was generally predicted well by both models. The models generally estimated the yield to within 10 to 15% of measured values. The models should be useful tools in evaluating the potential for soybean as an alternative crop in dryland rotations in the central Great Plains.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Management inputs that maximize economic return from the early soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production system have not been evaluated fully. The objective was to determine the effect of weed management on yield and net return from early planted maturity group (MG) IV and MG V glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine]-resistant (GR) and conventional (CONV) soybean cultivars grown in the early soybean production system with (IRR) and without (NI) irrigation. Field studies were conducted from 1996 through 1999 on Sharkey clay (very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Epiaquert) at Stoneville, MS (33°26′ N lat). Weed management systems were (i) pre-emergent (PRE) broadleaf followed by postemergent (POST) broadleaf and grass weed management (PRE + POST) and (ii) POST broadleaf and grass weed management (POST). Use of POST-only weed management was cheaper, yielded more, and resulted in greater net returns than did use of PRE + POST weed management with both CONV and GR cultivars. Under the conditions of this study, use of GR vs. CONV cultivars in an NI or low-yield environment resulted in greater profit ($52 vs. −$17 ha⁻¹ 3-yr average, respectively). Use of CONV vs. GR cultivars resulted in greater profit in an IRR or high yield environment ($382 vs. $266 ha⁻¹ 3-yr average, respectively). These results indicate that use of GR cultivars with POST-only weed management will result in greater profit in an NI environment while use of CONV cultivars with POST-only weed management will result in greater profit in an IRR environment.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Mapping mutants of classical linkage groups 6 and 8 (CLGs 6 and 8) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can enhance the identification of important agronomic traits. Genetic data suggest that CLGs 6 and 8 may belong to the same linkage group. Our objectives were to determine if CLGs 6 and 8 are the same or different linkage groups and to determine the gene order. Genotypes containing mutants of CLGs 6 and 8 and mutants of other CLGs were crossed in various combinations. Data for the different characters were collected from F2 populations and F(2:3) families. Recombination values confirmed that CLG 6 characters, Df2 and Y11 were linked (R = 27.0 +/- 5.9), Df2 was linked to Ms1 (CLG 8) (R = 24.8 +/- 1.2) and to W1 (CLG 8) (R = 36.4 +/- 1.3), and Y11 was linked to Ms1 (R = 31.7 +/- 1.4). F2 data suggested that Y11 segregated independently of W1, while F(2:3) data indicated the two were linked (R = 38.4 +/- 3.2). Our data indicated that CLGs 6 and 8 belong to the same linkage group, which is molecular linkage group F (MLG F), and chromosome 13. Y11 and Adh1 are at the ends of the chromosome segment studied, and Y23 is located between Ms6 and St5. Recombination values among the other loci of CLG 8, and between them and loci of other CLGs were consistent with published values. This information will be useful in the reassignment of CLGs, ordering of loci, and will enhance molecular genetic linkage mapping in soybean.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Protein and oil concentration are seed constituents that make soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] an important crop. Reports have been published that the oil concentration and recently the protein concentration of U.S. soybean has been decreasing with respect to other exporting countries. The objective of this study was to utilize 51 yr of two data sets, The Uniform Soybean Tests, Northern Region and Southern Region to determine long-term trends in these constituents. Oil and protein composition data of lines from Regional Summaries of Maturity Groups OO through VIII were used for the analysis. Mean oil concentration was higher in the Southern Region compared with the Northern Region (209 and 206 g kg⁻¹, respectively), as was protein concentration (411 and 407 g kg⁻¹, respectively). Maturity group means for oil and protein concentration ranged from 198 to 212 g kg⁻¹ and 404 to 414 g kg⁻¹, respectively. Oil concentration increased in both data sets to 1973 and abruptly decreased in 1974 (21 g kg⁻¹) to a low in 1982 (184 g kg⁻¹) to higher than average values in 1983 (217 g kg⁻¹) and by linear regression analysis, decreasing in the Northern Region since then. Analysis of lines evaluated from 1973 to 1974 and from 1982 to 1983 indicated that genetics was not the cause of the change in oil concentrations. Temporal protein concentrations were not as distinct as those of oil but indicated groups of years when protein concentration was above or below the mean. The data indicate that oil concentrations of soybean has been erratic and decreasing since 1974 because of unknown factors.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Seed size is an important attribute of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] for some food uses. The objectives of this study were to identify simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) markers associated with quantitative trait loci for seed size (SSQTL) and to compare the effectiveness of phenotypic selection and marker-assisted selection for seed size among individual F₂ plants. Three small-seeded lines were crossed to parents with normal seed size to form three two-parent populations. The parents of the populations were screened with 178 SSR markers to identify polymorphism. Population 1 (Pop 1) had 75 polymorphic SSR markers covering 1306 centimorgans (cM), Pop 2 had 70 covering 1143 cM, and Pop 3 had 82 covering 1237 cM. Seed size of each population was determined with 100 F₂ plants grown at Isabela, Puerto Rico, and their F₂–derived lines grown in two replications at three environments. Single-factor analysis of variance and multiple regression were used to determine significant marker-SSQTL associations. Population 1 had 12 markers that individually accounted for 8.1 to 14.9% of the variation for seed size combined across environments, Pop 2 had 16 markers that individually accounted for 7.8 to 36.5% of the variation, and Pop 3 had 22 markers that individually accounted for 8.6 to 28.8% of the variation. Three marker loci that had significant SSQTL associations in this study also were significant in previous research, and 13 markers had unique SSQTL associations. The relative effectiveness of phenotypic and marker-assisted selection among F₂ plants varied for the three populations. Averaged across the three populations, phenotypic selection for seed size was as effective and less expensive than marker-assisted selection.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The accumulation of over 30 years of basic research on the biology, genetic variation, and evolution of the wild perennial relatives of soybean (Glycine max) provides a foundation to improve cultivated soybean. The cultivated soybean and its wild progenitor, G. soja, have a center of origin in eastern Asia and are the only two species in the annual subgenus Soja. Systematic and evolutionary studies of the ca. 30 perennial species of subgenus Glycine, native to Australia, have benefited from the availability of the G. max genomic sequence. The perennial species harbor many traits of interest to soybean breeders, among them resistance to major soybean pathogens such as cyst nematode and leaf rust. New species in the Australian subgenus continue to be described, due to the collection of new material and to insights gleaned through systematic studies of accessions in germplasm collections. Ongoing studies in perennial species focus on genomic regions that contain genes for key traits relevant to soybean breeding. These comparisons also include the homoeologous regions that are the result of polyploidy in the common ancestor of all Glycine species. Subgenus Glycine includes a complex of recently formed allopolyploids that are the focus of studies aimed at elucidating genomic, transcriptomic, physiological, taxonomic, morphological, developmental, and ecological processes related to polyploid evolution. Here we review what has been learned over the past 30 years and outline ongoing work on photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and floral biology, much of it drawing on new technologies and resources.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Time of flowering is a quantitatively inherited character of agronomic importance in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The genetics of flowering time has been extensively studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The first objective of this study was to map onto the soybean genetic map orthologous genes known to be involved in photoperiod recognition and time of flowering in A. thaliana and compare their location with previously mapped flowering time quantitative trait loci (QTL). The second objective was to associate the mapped homologs with maturity (E) loci by means of near isogenic lines (NILs). Three single-cross soybean populations, consisting of two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations and one F₂ population, were used in the mapping study. One RIL population, IX132, was developed by crossing PI 317.336 and ‘Corsoy’; the second, IX136, by crossing PI 317.334B and Corsoy. Both plant introductions have been reported to be photoperiod-insensitive while the Corsoy parent has been reported to be photoperiod-sensitive. The RIL populations were previously used to map QTL for flowering time, maturity, and photoperiod-insensitivity in soybean. The F₂ population was developed from an interspecific cross between G max (breeding line A81-356022) and G. soja (PI 468.916). Eighteen soybean cDNA clones, identified by BLAST to have high similarities with 18 previously cloned A thaliana flowering time genes, were used as probes in this study. Ten of the 18 cDNA clones were mapped. The cDNAs were mapped onto linkage groups (LGs) A2 (CRY2), B1 and H (COL1), A1 and B2 (PHYA), C1 (DET1 and LD), D2 (AP2), E and K (PHYB), F (COL2), L (FCA), and Q (CCA1). None of the cDNAs were directly associated with previously mapped QTL for flowering time. Forty-one NILs and two recurrent parents (RPs) were used in the association study. Analyses of these candidate genes using contrasting NILs showed that the FCA homolog was associated with maturity locus E3 That FCA is a strong gene candidate for maturity locus E3 is further supported by map position and phenotypic data. Analyses of NILs suggest that the soybean homolog PHYB may be associated with maturity locus E1 However, current data show they mapped in different LGs.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Sudden death syndrome, caused by Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, has caused increased losses in soybean production in recent years. This study was done to identify potential sources of resistance to sudden death syndrome. Using a greenhouse screening procedure, 6,037 soybean plant introductions (PIs) were compared with a susceptible check, Great Lakes 3302, and two moderately resistant checks, PI 520.733 and PI 567.374, for resistance to sudden death syndrome. Only 57 PIs had foliar disease ratings that were not significantly different from PI 567.374 (P less than or equal to 0.05) 3 weeks after inoculation. Six PIs had lower ratings than PI 567.374 at 4 weeks after inoculation, while none had lower area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values. When comparing the PIs to PI 520.733, 209 PIs had foliar disease ratings not significantly different from PI 520.733 (P less than or equal to 0.05) 3 weeks after inoculation. Eight PIs had significantly lower disease severity ratings 4 weeks after inoculation, and 38 PIs had significantly lower AUDPC values than PI 520.733. Additionally, root lesion lengths were measured 4 weeks after inoculation and ranged from 25.2 to 41.5 mm for all the PIs; none of the entries had smaller lesion lengths than the susceptible check Great Lakes 3302. The correlation between lesion length and disease foliar severity rating was not significant. There also were no plant morphological characteristics (i.e., flower color or seed coat color) associated with higher sudden death syndrome foliar symptoms. Eighteen PIs previously identified as moderately resistant with differing agronomic traits were inoculated with five different isolates of Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines. Results indicated that resistance in these 18 PIs was effective against all five isolates of Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines. Isolate Mont-1 caused the greatest disease severity ratings. These PIs that exhibited low foliar severity ratings may provide new sources of resistance for the development of new sudden death syndrome-resistant lines and cultivars.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Background and Aims Despite differences in physiology between dry and relative moist seeds, seed ageing tests most often use a temperature and seed moisture level that are higher than during dry storage used in commercial practice and gene banks. This study aimed to test whether seed ageing under dry conditions can be accelerated by storing under high-pressure oxygen. Methods Dry barley (Hordeum vulgare), cabbage (Brassica oleracea), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and soybean (Glycine max) seeds were stored between 2 and 7 weeks in steel tanks under 18 MPa partial pressure of oxygen. Storage under high-pressure nitrogen gas or under ambient air pressure served as controls. The method was compared with storage at 45 °C after equilibration at 85 % relative humidity and long-term storage at the laboratory bench. Germination behaviour, seedling morphology and tocopherol levels were assessed. Key Results The ageing of the dry seeds was indeed accelerated by storing under high-pressure oxygen. The morphological ageing symptoms of the stored seeds resembled those observed after ageing under long-term dry storage conditions. Barley appeared more tolerant of this storage treatment compared with lettuce and soybean. Less-mature harvested cabbage seeds were more sensitive, as was the case for primed compared with non-primed lettuce seeds. Under high-pressure oxygen storage the tocopherol levels of dry seeds decreased, in a linear way with the decline in seed germination, but remained unchanged in seeds deteriorated during storage at 45 °C after equilibration at 85 % RH. Conclusions Seed storage under high-pressure oxygen offers a novel and relatively fast method to study the physiology and biochemistry of seed ageing at different seed moisture levels and temperatures, including those that are representative of the dry storage conditions as used in gene banks and commercial practice.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Background and Aims Leaf hydraulic properties are strongly linked with transpiration and photosynthesis in many species. However, it is not known if gas exchange and hydraulics will have co-ordinated responses to climate change. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of leaf hydraulic conductance (K ₗₑₐf) in Glycine max (soybean) to growth at elevated [CO ₂] and increased temperature compared with the responses of leaf gas exchange and leaf water status. Methods Two controlled-environment growth chamber experiments were conducted with soybean to measure K ₗₑₐf, stomatal conductance (g ₛ) and photosynthesis (A) during growth at elevated [CO ₂] and temperature relative to ambient levels. These results were validated with field experiments on soybean grown under free-air elevated [CO ₂] (FACE) and canopy warming. Key results In chamber studies, K ₗₑₐf did not acclimate to growth at elevated [CO ₂], even though stomatal conductance decreased and photosynthesis increased. Growth at elevated temperature also did not affect K ₗₑₐf, although g ₛ and A showed significant but inconsistent decreases. The lack of response of K ₗₑₐf to growth at increased [CO ₂] and temperature in chamber-grown plants was confirmed with field-grown soybean at a FACE facility. Conclusions Leaf hydraulic and leaf gas exchange responses to these two climate change factors were not strongly linked in soybean, although g ₛ responded to [CO ₂] and increased temperature as previously reported. This differential behaviour could lead to an imbalance between hydraulic supply and transpiration demand under extreme environmental conditions likely to become more common as global climate continues to change.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Background and Aims The timing of flowering has a direct impact on successful seed production in plants. Flowering of soybean (Glycine max) is controlled by several E loci, and previous studies identified the genes responsible for the flowering loci E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 . However, natural variation in these genes has not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were the identification of new alleles, establishment of allele diagnoses, examination of allelic combinations for adaptability, and analysis of the integrated effect of these loci on flowering. Methods The sequences of these genes and their flanking regions were determined for 39 accessions by primer walking. Systematic discrimination among alleles was performed using DNA markers. Genotypes at the E1 – E4 loci were determined for 63 accessions covering several ecological types using DNA markers and sequencing, and flowering times of these accessions at three sowing times were recorded. Key Results A new allele with an insertion of a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) at the promoter of the E1 locus (e1-re) was identified. Insertion and deletion of 36 bases in the eighth intron (E2-in and E2-dl) were observed at the E2 locus. Systematic discrimination among the alleles at the E1 – E3 loci was achieved using PCR-based markers. Allelic combinations at the E1 – E4 loci were found to be associated with ecological types, and about 62–66 % of variation of flowering time could be attributed to these loci. Conclusions The study advances understanding of the combined roles of the E1 – E4 loci in flowering and geographic adaptation, and suggests the existence of unidentified genes for flowering in soybean.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Background The legume family (Leguminosae) consists of approx. 17 000 species. A few of these species, including, but not limited to, Phaseolus vulgaris , Cicer arietinum and Cajanus cajan , are important dietary components, providing protein for approx. 300 million people worldwide. Additional species, including soybean (Glycine max) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), are important crops utilized mainly in animal feed. In addition, legumes are important contributors to biological nitrogen, forming symbiotic relationships with rhizobia to fix atmospheric N ₂ and providing up to 30 % of available nitrogen for the next season of crops. The application of high-throughput genomic technologies including genome sequencing projects, genome re-sequencing (DNA-seq) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) by the legume research community has provided major insights into genome evolution, genomic architecture and domestication. Scope and Conclusions This review presents an overview of the current state of legume genomics and explores the role that next-generation sequencing technologies play in advancing legume genomics. The adoption of next-generation sequencing and implementation of associated bioinformatic tools has allowed researchers to turn each species of interest into their own model organism. To illustrate the power of next-generation sequencing, an in-depth overview of the transcriptomes of both soybean and white lupin (Lupinus albus) is provided. The soybean transcriptome focuses on analysing seed development in two near-isogenic lines, examining the role of transporters, oil biosynthesis and nitrogen utilization. The white lupin transcriptome analysis examines how phosphate deficiency alters gene expression patterns, inducing the formation of cluster roots. Such studies illustrate the power of next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analyses in elucidating the gene networks underlying biological processes.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed protein is negatively correlated with seed oil and often with yield. Our goal was to examine the basis for these correlations at a quantitative genetic locus (QTL) level. Seventy-six F₅–derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the mating of the high-protein (480 g protein per kg seed) G. max accession PI 437088A with the high-yield cultivar Asgrow A3733 (420 g kg⁻¹ seed protein content) were evaluated in six irrigation treatments (i.e., 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, and 0% replacement of weekly evapotranspiration loss) of a two-replicate experiment conducted for 2 yr. The RILs were genotyped with 329 random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), 103 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and four other markers, creating a 2943-centimorgan (cM) genetic map of 35 linkage group (LGs) that, on the basis of SSR homology, aligned with the 20 known soybean LGs. The phenotypic regression of RIL protein and oil on yield revealed respective linear coefficients of −2.6 and +1.6 percentage points per kg ha⁻¹ (a protein/oil exchange ratio of −1.6). A seed protein, oil, and yield QTL mapped close to RAPD marker OPAW13a in a small LG-I interval that was flanked by the SSR markers Satt496 and Satt239. The additive effects of the PI 437088A allele on seed protein, oil, and yield were a respective +1.0 and −0.6 percentage points (a protein/oil ratio of −1.6) and −154 kg ha⁻¹ Given that the genetic-based protein/oil exchange ratio of 1.6 is smaller than the 2.0 calorific-based oil/protein ratio, one might expect the remaining 0.4 units of carbon and/or energy to be made available for other seed dry matter. However, yield almost invariably falls when seed protein is genetically enhanced at the expense of seed oil, suggesting that protein synthesis and its deposition in the seed is energetically more costly to the plant than is commonly assumed.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Background and Aims Proteins containing the SPX (SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) domain are vital components in the phosphorus (P) signalling pathway, and regulate phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in plants. However, the characteristics and functions of GmSPX members in soybean (Glycine max) remain largely unknown. Methods BLAST searching revealed nine GmSPX members in the soybean genome. Subsequently, expression patterns of GmSPX members were investigated in various tissues of soybean grown in nutrient solution or sand culture through quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Sub-cellular localization of GmSPX was examined via transient expression of 35S:GmSPX-GFP in epidermal cells of onion (Allium cepa). Finally, soybean transgenic composite plants were generated to study GmSPX3 functions. Key Results Nine GmSPX members were identified, which were classified into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Diverse responses of GmSPX members to deficiencies of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and iron) or inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia were observed in soybean. In addition, variations of sub-cellular localization of GmSPX members were found. Among them, GmSPX3, GmSPX7 and GmSPX8 were localized in the nuclei, and the other GmSPX members were confined to the nuclei and cytoplasm. The nuclear-localized and Pi starvation responsive-gene, GmSPX3 , was functionally analysed in soybean transgenic composite plants. Overexpression of GmSPX3 led to increased P concentrations in both shoots and roots in the high-P treatment, and increased transcription of seven Pi starvation-responsive genes in soybean hairy roots. Conclusions Taken together, the results suggest that GmSPX3 is a positive regulator in the P signalling network, and controls Pi homeostasis in soybean.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Seed cell wall polysaccharides (CWPs) represent a significant portion of seed dry matter (DM) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. To further investigate the role of seed CWP in determining seed traits, relationships were examined among monosaccharide constituents of CWP and between CWP, yield, maturity, seed weight, and protein and oil content using principal component (PC) analysis in 13 Minnesota-adapted cultivars. Monosaccharide data were used to form PCs. Principal Component 1 mainly described pectin polysaccharides composed of rhamnose and galactose and was negatively correlated with the sum of protein and oil content (protein + oil) (r = −0.58). Cellulose, hemicellulose, and arabinose-containing polysaccharides as described by PC2 were negatively correlated with yield (r = −0.59), suggesting lower seed content in these CWP relates to an increase in yield. Seed arabinose:galactose (Ara:Gal) ratio was negatively correlated with yield and maturity and may be an indicator of the average stage of seed cell wall development for a cultivar at maturity. Principal Components 2, 3, and 4 combined to form a stepwise regression equation (R ² = 0.69) for seed weight with PC4 providing the most weight in the equation. This equation implicates linear and backbone polysaccharides as being most important in relation to seed weight. Thus, individual polysaccharide types were correlated with either yield, protein + oil, or seed weight. Lower seed content of CWP was correlated with beneficial changes in seed traits, suggesting that reducing CWP content may provide an additional seed trait improvement.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Nitrogen fixation in soybean (Glycine max Merr.) is especially sensitive to soil drying. The basis of this sensitivity appears to be related to the fact that ureides are transported from the nodules, and the ureide concentrations increase with water deficits in leaves resulting in an apparent feedback to nodules involving ureides that inhibit activity. Therefore, sustained ureide catabolism in the leaves under water deficit appears to be critical for N₂ fixation tolerance. Recently, eight plant introduction lines were identified that expressed substantial N₂ fixation tolerance of water deficits. The focus of this study was to explore the basis for the tolerance previously observed in the eight lines. Specifically, the objective of this study was to evaluate in these genotypes the dependence for ureide catabolism on allantoate amidinohydrolase, which in other cultivars appears to be related to N₂ fixation tolerance of water deficits. Since allantoate amidinohydrolase does not require Mn as a co-factor in contrast to the alternate enzyme for allantoic acid catabolism, ureide accumulation was measured in leaves of these genotypes after the plants were fed allantoic acid following growth on low Mn hydroponic solutions. This treatment confirmed that ureide accumulation was independent of Mn nutrition level in six of the eight tolerant lines. Ureide accumulation in PI 429328 was consistently the most insensitive to Mn nutrition level. Overall, these results indicated that ureide catabolism independent of Mn is active in six of the eight plant introduction lines identified to express N₂ fixation tolerance to soil drying.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Climate change due to increased [CO₂] and elevated temperature may impact the composition of crop seed. This study was conducted to determine the potential effects of climate change on composition and gene expression of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. ‘Bragg’] seed. Soybean plants were grown in sunlit, controlled environment chambers under diel, sinusoidal temperatures of 28/18, 32/22, 36/26, 40/30, and 44/34°C (day/night, maximum/minimum), and two levels of [CO₂], 350 and 700 μmol mol⁻¹, imposed during the entire life cycle. The effect of temperature on mature seed composition and transcripts in developing seed was pronounced, but there was no effect of [CO₂]. Total oil concentration was highest at 32/22°C and decreased with further increase in temperature. Oleic acid concentration increased with increasing temperature whereas linolenic acid decreased. Concentrations of N and P increased with temperature to 40/30°C, then decreased. Total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) decreased as temperatures increased, and the proportion of soluble sugars to starch decreased. Transcripts of a gene that is downregulated by auxin (ADR12) were dramatically downregulated by elevated temperature, possibly reflecting the altered course of seed development under environmental stress. Transcripts of β-glucosidase, a gene expressed during normal soybean seed development, were detected in seed grown at 28/18°C but not in seed grown at 40/30°C, which also suggests that normal programs affecting seed composition were perturbed by elevated temperature. These results confirm previous studies indicating that high temperature alters soybean seed composition, and suggest possible mechanisms by which climate change may affect soybean seed development and composition.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Effects of cerium (Ce) on photosynthetic pigments and photochemical reaction activity in soybean (Glycine max L.) under ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation stress were studied under laboratory conditions. UV-B radiation caused the decrease in chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, Hill reaction activity, photophosphorylation rate and Mg2+-ATPase activity. Ce (III) (20 mg L−1) could alleviate UV-B-induced inhibition to these photosynthetic parameters because values of these photosynthetic parameters in Ce (III) + UV-B treatment were obviously higher than those with UV-B treatment alone. Dynamic changes of the above photosynthetic parameters show that Ce (III) could slow down the decrease rate of these photosynthetic parameters during a 5-day UV-B radiation and quicken the restoration during recovery period. The final restoration degree of five parameters mentioned above in leaves exposed to low level of UV-B radiation (0.15 W m2) was higher than that exposed to high level (0.45 W m2). Correlating net photosynthetic rate with other four parameters, we found that the regulating mechanisms Ce (ΠΙ) on photosynthesis under various level of UV-B radiation were not the same. The protective effects of Ce (III) on photosynthesis in plants were influenced by the intensity of UV-B radiation.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield in claypan soils varies systematically with soil properties and landscape position. This is likely caused by soil interactions with soybean roots. Field observations of soybean root distribution are needed to reveal its effect on yield variability. This study examined profile distributions of soybean root length density (RLD) and average root diameter (ARD) as a function of landscape position, depth to claypan (DTC), apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECₐ), clay-maximum translated depth (D ₜ), and other soil properties. A landscape of claypan soils was sampled postharvest at two sites near Centralia, MO, in 2001. Roots were washed from soil cores in 15-cm layers (15–120 cm) and measured with image analysis. Root length density and ARD were significantly related to landscape position, DTC, D ₜ, and ECₐ Predictions of RLD and ARD were best from 15 to 60 cm, the depths with the greatest influence from claypan soil morphology. Soil profile distributions of base cations, P, and pH matched root density profiles. Soybean roots were inhibited in E horizons above the claypan and stimulated 20 to 40 cm below it. Soybean roots below the claypan had about 20 to 30% smaller diameter. We conclude that DTC and rapid estimators of claypan morphology, such as ECₐ, can be used to predict soybean root distribution in claypan soil landscapes.</str>

    <str name="abstract">In the southern Great Plains, dryland double-cropping soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] after winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) could provide quality summer forage, partially offset mineral fertilizer N applied to winter wheat, and lessen soil erosion. Waiting for wheat grain to mature, however, delays soybean planting and subjects growth to dry and hot conditions. Planting soybean after a hay crop of wheat was investigated to determine the feasibility of the system as a source of livestock feeds and N uptake by both crops. Twelve treatment combinations of two wheat fertilizer N levels (0 and 112 kg N ha⁻¹) and six summer management treatments (fallow: conventional and no-till; soybean: grazed, cut for hay, green manure, and mulch) were arranged in strips across four replications. Soybean biomass ranged from 1.35 to 1.90 Mg ha⁻¹ when soybean grazing and harvest occurred at seed fill, and crude protein ranged from 129 to 220 g kg⁻¹ resulting in a 3-yr average N uptake of 44 kg ha⁻¹ Within each N fertilizer level, average wheat forage yields were not different, but yield increased 29% with N fertilizer and crude protein was inversely related to yield. Double-cropped soybean failed to offer any yield-enhancing N benefit to wheat or enhance soil N and C content after 3 yr, even when used as a green manure. Unless a producer is willing to accept the low productivity of soybean as a double crop with wheat, the feasibility of this dryland double-crop forage system is limited.</str>

    <str name="abstract">UV-screening by terrestrial plants is a crucial trait since colonization of terrestrial environments has started. In general, it is enabled by phenolic substances. Especially for grasses it remains unclear why plants grown under the absence of UV-B-radiation exhibit nonetheless a high UV-B-screening potential. But this may be explained by the UV-screening effect of the silicon double layer. It was shown for seedlings of soybeans (Glycine max L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that enhanced silicon supply reduces stress induced by UV-radiation. Even more important is a direct correlation between silicon content in the epidermis near area (intercellular spaces) and the absorption of UV-radiation in this area shown in other papers. The silicon double layer may act like a glass layer and decreases the transmission of UV-radiation at the epidermis near area. In summary, the absorbance/reflection of ultraviolet radiation is dependent on the characteristics of the epidermis near area of leaves, particularly the occurrence (qualitatively and quantitatively) of phenolic substances and/or a silicon double layer in this area. Consequently, UV-screening by plant silicon double layer should get more attention in future research with emphasis on effects of UV-radiation on plant physiology.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Ecophysiological models are increasingly used as research and decision support tools in agriculture, but it is often difficult to assess how suitable a model is for a particular application. Model evaluations usually involve bivariate linear regression between observed and simulated values, which assumes statistical independence among observed values. However, observed data often have dependencies if they originate from series of experiments or involve experiments using nested designs (e.g., with split plots). By representing experiments, cultivars, or other variables as factors, linear regression models can specify expected dependencies, permitting analyses that are statistically more rigorous and provide more insights into model performance. This study evaluated the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CROPGRO-Soybean model using regressions that included environment and cultivars as factors as well as continuous variables such as temperature or daylength. When applied to 28 data sets for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], representing 113 treatment combinations, the regressions showed that the model simulated days to anthesis and grain yield well for a wide range of environments. Differences among environments represented a larger portion of unexplained variation than did differences among cultivars. Further improvements thus might be sought in modeling crop response to environment rather than in representing cultivar differences, or alternatively, in characterizing soil profiles or daily weather rather than cultivars. A submodel for photosynthesis that scaled leaf-level values to canopy simulated grain yield more accurately than a simpler submodel. Multiple regressions provided much more information on model performance than simple bivariate comparisons.</str>

    <str name="abstract">The mechanism of temperature adaptation in plants, including the formation of polyunsaturates in seed storage lipids, most likely involves transcriptional as well as post-translational regulation of fatty acid desaturase activity. The present investigation was conducted to measure changes in the transcript accumulation among the three members of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene family in response to altered growth temperature during seed development. Microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturases catalyze the insertion of a third double bond into linoleic (18:2Δ⁹, ¹²) acid to produce linolenic (18:3Δ⁹, ¹², ¹⁵) acid. At 35 d after flowering, transcript accumulation (normalized for soybean actin) of GmFAD3A decreased by 5- to 15-fold, GmFAD3B by 2- to 9-fold, and GmFAD3C by 2- to 3-fold in seeds that developed in a warm (day/night [D/N] = 30/26°C) versus a normal (D/N = 26/22°C) or a cool (D/N = 22/18°C) environment. At this stage of seed development, decreased omega-3 desaturase gene expression levels were positively associated with reductions of 39 to 50% in the linolenic acid content of seeds of three soybean varieties examined. Thus, transcriptional regulation of the microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene family likely accounts, at least in part, for the reduced linolenic acid levels in soybean seeds grown at elevated temperature.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Charcoal rot [Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid] of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a disease of economic significance throughout the world. Progress in developing resistant genotypes has been hampered because of a lack of reliable and efficient methods for assessment of soybean genotypes. Researchers need a common system for classifying soybean genotypes for their reaction to M. phaseolina that is consistent across environments. We propose a classification system based on a colony-forming unit index (CFUI), derived by dividing the colony-forming unit (CFU) value of a given genotype by the CFU value of a susceptible standard. Four other assessment methods were compared and correlated to CFUI: percent height of stem discoloration measured at R7, foliar symptoms taken at R7, area under the disease progress curve based on foliar symptom data collected four times during the growing season up to R7, and the intensity of internal root and stem discoloration taken at R7 (root and stem severity [RSS]). Twenty-four soybean genotypes in Maturity Groups III through V were evaluated in 2002 and 2003 in naturally and artificially infested fields. Based on the CFUI, four genotypes were classified as moderately resistant to M. phaseolina Among the disease assessment methods, RSS had the highest correlation with CFUI (r = 0.71 in 2002 and r = 0.69 in 2003). The CFUI provided a good measure of disease resistance across environments but was still time consuming. The RSS provided a less-accurate but more-rapid alternative that may be suitable for some breeding strategies.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Prior work showed that CO₂ enhancement ratios (ER) were similar for plants grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) whether grown in the ground or in insulated containers aboveground. Per plant comparisons were suspect since the ground-grown plants were cultivated in rows at normal densities making it difficult to separate the effects of plant competition from the variables of interest. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Essex] was grown in the ground and in aboveground containers in OTCs in ambient and elevated CO₂ at equal planting densities. The hypothesis was that at equal densities, container- and ground-grown plants would exhibit both equivalent ERs and equivalent per plant yields. Although the only differences in net photosynthetic rate (Aₙ:μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) and conductance to water vapor (gₛ:mol m⁻² s⁻¹) were due to CO₂ and container- and ground-grown plants had similar ERs (mean = 20%), per plant yields were still less in the container-grown plants at both levels of CO₂ (mean = −17%). Reproductive measures, except mass per seed, as well as total stem biomass were significantly reduced in the containers. High CO₂ increased seed oil concentration and the level of fatty acid saturation. The only observed environmental difference was higher daytime root zone temperatures in containers (2–6°C). The robust ERs suggest that neither above- nor below-ground resource limitations was the cause of the yield discrepancies.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is a major viral pathogen, affecting soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production worldwide. The Rsv3 gene of soybean confers resistance to three of the most virulent strains (G5–G7) of SMV. The objectives of this study were to map Rsv3 and develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) purposes. Disease-response data were collected from two F₂ mapping populations, L29 (Rsv3) × Lee68 (rsv3) and Tousan 140 (Rsv3) × Lee68 (rsv3). Bulk segregant analysis based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers demonstrated that the Rsv3 locus maps to the soybean molecular linkage group (MLG) B2 between restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers A519 and Mng247. These two tightly linked RFLP markers were converted to PCR-based markers to expedite MAS. Sequence analysis of the Mng247 genomic region revealed similarity to the consensus sequence of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) characteristic of the extracellular LRR class of disease resistance genes. Results from this study will be useful in pyramiding viral resistance genes and in cloning the Rsv3 gene.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Palmitic acid is one of the two major saturated fatty acids of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil that is closely related to nutritional quality of soybean oil. Reduction of palmitic acid content would lower the total saturated fatty acid content of soybean oil and improve the oil quality for human consumption. Several mutant lines with reduced palmitic acid content have been developed in which the genes conditioning palmitic acid content are located at different loci. The objective of this research was to map the genes conferring reduced palmitic acid from N87-2122-4 on the public soybean genetic linkage map with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Four near-isogenic lines with normal and reduced palmitic acid content and the F₂ and F₂:₃ generations of a population derived from the cross of ‘Cook’ × N87-2122-4 were used to perform the SSR mapping of the genes conditioning reduced palmitic acid. The results indicated that a major gene with an allele for reduced palmitic acid contributed by N87-2122-4 is located near the top of Linkage Group (LG) A1. A SSR marker, Satt684 in that region accounted for 38% of variation in palmitic acid content in the F₂ generation and 31% of variation in the F₂:₃ generation. On LG-M, Satt175 accounted for 8% of the variation in the F₂ and 9% of the variation in the F₂:₃ generation. This minor gene on LG-M had a significant interaction with the gene on LG-A1 in the F₂ generation. When combined in a multiple regression equation, these markers explained 51% of total phenotypic variation for palmitic acid content in the F₂ and 43% of the variation in the F₂:₃ generations.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Because soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is the world's most important source of high quality vegetable protein, development of high yielding genotypes with increased seed protein concentration is a major soybean breeding objective. A major impediment to this objective is the often observed negative correlation between yield and protein. Seed density is a component of grain yield that is correlated positively with seed protein concentration. If genotypic correlations between seed density and yield are low, selection for increased density could provide an efficient way to improve protein concentration without affecting seed yield. The objective of this study was to investigate direct and correlated responses to selection on density of seeds sampled from male-sterile plants in three different random-mating populations. Seed density was determined for 192 male-sterile plants in each population. In each population, 15 plants with the highest and 15 plants with lowest seed density were selected. Seeds of each selection were increased in the winter and tested the following summer at three locations in North Carolina with two replications per location. In those tests, the previously selected high and low density groups were not significantly different in seed density, seed weight, yield, or concentrations of protein and oil. Thus, single plant selection for seed density was ineffective for increasing seed density or seed protein concentration. An alternative selection method is proposed in which the selection unit is a selfed half-sib or S₁ family. Desired gains selection indices for increased density and seed weight may increase both protein and yield in all three populations. This selection system has appeal because measurement of seed density and seed weight is relatively inexpensive, requiring less economic and land resources than actual measurement of yield and protein. It is recommended as a low-cost way to improve initially unadapted populations.</str>

    <str name="abstract">In a survey of the biodiversity and biogeography of rhizobia associated with soybean (Glycine max L.) in different sites of the Northern (Huang-Huai-Hai) Plain of China, ten strains were defined as representing a novel genomic species in the genus of Bradyrhizobium. They were distinguished from defined species in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the 16S–23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (IGS). In BOX-PCR, these strains presented two patterns that shared 94 % similarity, demonstrating that they were a homogenous group with limited diversity. In phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, IGS and housekeeping gene sequences, four representative strains formed a distant lineage within the genus Bradyrhizobium, which was consistent with the results of DNA–DNA hybridization. The strains of this novel group formed effective nodules with G. max, Glycine soja and Vigna unguiculata in cross-nodulation tests and harboured symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) identical to those of reference strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense and ‘Bradyrhizobium daqingense’ originating from soybean, implying that the novel group may have obtained these symbiotic genes by lateral gene transfer. In analyses of cellular fatty acids and phenotypic features, some differences were found between the novel group and related Bradyrhizobium species, demonstrating that the novel group is distinct phenotypically from other Bradyrhizobium species. Based upon the data obtained, these strains are proposed to represent a novel species, Bradyrhizobium huanghuaihaiense sp. nov., with CCBAU 23303T ( = LMG 26136T = CGMCC 1.10948T = HAMBI 3180T) as the type strain. The DNA G+C content of strain CCBAU 23303T is 61.5 mol% (Tm).</str>

    <str name="abstract">A novel ikarugamycin-producing actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-Da3T, was isolated from soybean root [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and characterized using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain NEAU-Da3T belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was most closely related to Streptomyces carpaticus NRRL B-16359T (99.5 %), Streptomyces cheonanensis VC-A46T (99.3 %) and Streptomyces xiamenensis MCCC 1A01550T (97.2 %); similarities to other type strains of species of the genus Streptomyces were lower than 97.1 %. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolate formed a distinct phyletic line with S. carpaticus NRRL B-16359T, S. cheonanensis VC-A46T and S. xiamenensis MCCC 1A01550T. This branching pattern was also supported by the tree reconstructed with the neighbour-joining method. A comparative study between strain NEAU-Da3T and the type strains of the closest related species of the genus Streptomyces revealed that it differed from them in morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. Therefore, it is proposed that strain NEAU-Da3T represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces harbinensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-Da3T ( = CGMCC 4.7047T = DSM 42076T).</str>

    <str name="abstract">Thirteen slow-growing rhizobial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean (Glycine max L.) grown in Daqing city in China were classified in the genus Bradyrhizobium based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis of IGS, atpD, glnII and recA genes revealed that the isolates represented a novel clade in this genus. DNA–DNA relatedness lower than 42.5 % between the representative strain CCBAU 15774T and the type strains of the closely related species Bradyrhizobium liaoningense USDA 3622T, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense CCBAU 10071T and Bradyrhizobium betae LMG 21987T, further confirmed that this group represented a novel species. CCBAU 15774T shared seven cellular fatty acids with the three above-mentioned species, but the fatty acids 15 : 0 iso and summed feature 5 (18 : 2ω6,9c and/or 18 : 0 anteiso) were unique for this strain. The respiratory quinone in CCBAU 15774T was ubiquinone-10 and the cellular polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, cardiolipin and unknown aminolipid, polar lipid and phospholipid. In addition, some phenotypic features could be used to differentiate the novel group from the related species. On basis of these results, we propose the name Bradyrhizobium daqingense sp. nov., with CCBAU 15774T ( = LMG 26137T = HAMBI 3184T = CGMCC 1.10947T) as the type strain. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 61.2 mol% (Tm).</str>

    <str name="abstract">A borrelidin-producing actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-W2T, was isolated from the root surface of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] and characterized using a polyphasic approach. The organism was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of streptomycetes. The G+C content of the DNA was 66.12 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NEAU-W2T revealed that the strain formed a distinct clade within the 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic tree and showed highest similarity (99.61 %) to Streptomyces neyagawaensis ATCC 27449T. However, the DNA–DNA relatedness between strain NEAU-W2T and S. neyagawaensis ATCC 27449T was 58.51 %. Strain NEAU-W2T could also be differentiated from S. neyagawaensis ATCC 27449T and other Streptomyces species showing high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98–99 %), as well as other borrelidin-producing strains, based on morphological and physiological characteristics. On the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is proposed that strain NEAU-W2T represents a novel Streptomyces species, Streptomyces heilongjiangensis sp. nov. The type strain is NEAU-W2T ( = CGMCC 4.7004T = ATCC BAA-2424T = DSM 42073T).</str>

    <str name="abstract">Japan is a historical center of genetic diversity for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], but diversity of modern Japanese cultivars is not well characterized. The objectives of this study were to quantify genetic diversity of Japanese cultivars via coefficient of parentage (CP), determine the relative importance of breeding factors in explaining that diversity, and incorporate results into a practical guide for management of diversity. All 86 public Japanese cultivars released and registered during 1950 to 1988 were subjected to CP and multivariate analysis. The mean CP for the 86 cultivars was low (0.04), indicating a potentially high degree of diversity in Japanese breeding. Eighty percent of all pairs of cultivars were completely unrelated by pedigree. The low mean CP for the cultivars was attributed to a continual incorporation of unique Japanese land races into the genetic base over time, to the introduction of foreign germplasm from China and the United States and Canada (US-CAN) as breeding stock, and to limited exchange of germplasm among Japanese breeding programs. Cluster analysis was an effective discriminator of diversity. Six clusters were identified which had a mean CP value equivalent to that of half-sibs or greater. These clusters encompassed a total of 54 cultivars, explained 57% of the variation in the CP relations, and had few ancestors in common. Each cluster was derived primarily from only a few programs. Backcrossing and full-sib matings were absent in Japanese pedigrees and, thus, clusters were formed primarily from parent-offspring, full-sib, and half-sib relations. Cultivar attributes such as growing region, release era, maturity designation, and developing institution did not elucidate strong patterns of pedigree diversity. In practical breeding, one may maximize the chances of finding good specific Japanese × Japanese or Japanese × US-CAN crosses by choosing Japanese cultivars from a wide array of Japanese clusters rather than sampling extensively within a cluster.</str>

    <str name="abstract">A Gram-staining-negative, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive strain, designated CCNWSP36-1T, was isolated from the nodule surface of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] cultivar Zhonghuang 13. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis clearly showed that the isolate represented a member of the genus Sphingobacterium. On the basis of pairwise comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain CCNWSP36-1T showed 96.8 % similarity to Sphingobacterium nematocida CCTCC AB 2010390T and less than 95.2 % similarity to other members of the genus Sphingobacterium. Growth of strain CCNWSP36-1T occurred at 10–40 °C and at pH 5.0–9.0. The NaCl range (w/v) for growth was 0–4 %. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and several unidentified polar lipids. Sphingolipid was present. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 41.1 mol%. As the physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain CCNWSP36-1T and the type strains of its closest phylogenetic neighbours showed clear differences, a novel species, Sphingobacterium yanglingense, is proposed. The type strain is CCNWSP36-1T ( = ACCC 19328T = JCM 30166T).</str>

    <str name="abstract">Sixteen strains of symbiotic bacteria from root nodules of Glycine max grown in Ottawa, Canada, were previously characterized and placed in a novel group within the genus Bradyrhizobium. To verify their taxonomic status, these strains were further characterized using a polyphasic approach. All strains possessed identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that were 99.79 % similar to the closest relative, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense LMG 18230T. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated atpD, glnII, recA, gyrB, rpoB and dnaK genes divided the 16 strains into three multilocus sequence types that were placed in a highly supported lineage distinct from named species of the genus Bradyrhizobium consistent with results of DNA–DNA hybridization. Based on analysis of symbiosis gene sequences (nodC and nifH), all novel strains were placed in a phylogenetic group with five species of the genus Bradyrhizobium that nodulate soybeans. The combination of phenotypic characteristics from several tests including carbon and nitrogen source utilization and antibiotic resistance could be used to differentiate representative strains from recognized species of the genus Bradyrhizobium. Novel strain OO99T elicits effective nodules on Glycine max, Glycine soja and Macroptilium atropurpureum, partially effective nodules on Desmodium canadense and Vigna unguiculata, and ineffective nodules on Amphicarpaea bracteata and Phaseolus vulgaris. Based on the data presented, we conclude that our strains represent a novel species for which the name Bradyrhizobium ottawaense sp. nov. is proposed, with OO99T ( = LMG 26739T = HAMBI 3284T) as the type strain. The DNA G+C content is 62.6 mol%.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Soybean (Glycine max) is planted from late March through June in the midsouthern USA due to time, production, and environmental constraints. These plantings may utilize cultivars from maturity groups (MG) IV through VII, and are grown in both nonirrigated and irrigated environments. In irrigated April and May plantings, MG IV cultivars produced greater yields with greater irrigation efficiency than did MG V, VI, and VII cultivars. In nonirrigated April plantings, MG IV and V cultivars produced yields similar to each other. In nonirrigated early-May plantings, cultivars from all MGs produced similar yields, but days to maturity increased with increasing MG. In nonirrigated late-May plantings, MG V through VII cultivars had greater yields, whereas MG VI and VII cultivars yielded the most in nonirrigated plantings made after 31 May. This study shows that planting cultivars that are later than necessary for maximum yield results in increased days to maturity and a concurrent greater risk of detrimental late-season effects from drought and pests regardless of the planting date.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Post-Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land may provide an excellent opportunity to satisfy certified organic crop production requirements. However, conversion of CRP or long-term pastureland to certified organic production will require tillage because the use of herbicides is prohibited in organic production. Our objectives were to evaluate stand establishment, weed competition, yield, and grain quality for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), corn (Zea mays L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) planted following primary tillage of bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) sod in south-central Iowa. Primary tillage treatments were fall moldboard plowing, fall tillage with a Kverneland(R) plow, fall and spring tillage with a Howard Rotavator(R), and spring moldboard plowing. Type of primary tillage did not affect first-crop soybean yield in the first year of the study, but first-crop soybean yields were greatest with spring moldboard plowing in the second year's evaluation. Corn yields in the second year plots were greater for both the fall and spring moldboard plow treatments than for the fall/spring rotary tillage treatment. Rotary hoeing reduced soybean stand more than expected (∼40%) in the first year, but differences among primary tillage treatments were not significant. In the second year, the rotary tillage treatment had significantly lower soybean stand, possibly because of surface crusting. There were some significant differences in grass and broad leaf weed populations in the corn and soybean each year, but overall weed control was considered sufficient. Insect pressure from corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis [Hübner]) and beanleaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcata [Forster]) was below economic threshold levels. Crop yields exceeded the county average each year, suggesting that weed and insect pest competition were negligible. We conclude that organic grain crops can be successfully produced following CRP or other long-term hay/pasture crops regardless of the primary tillage method used to till the sod.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Producers are frequently most interested in economic comparisons of various cropping systems. We compared continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and continuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with 2-, 3-, and 5-year rotations, the latter two including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), using either chisel plow or no-tillage practices. Crop yield and returns to land and management were evaluated. Yields for continuous corn (C-C-C) were not different from those in rotation [corn-soybean (C-S), soybean-wheat/soybean-corn (S-W/S-C), or corn-soybean-alfalfa-alfalfa-alfalfa (C-S-A-A-A)] for either tillage practice, but rotated corn had lower nitrogen (N) inputs. Soybean yield in the 5-year rotation was greater than for continuous soybean (S-S-S) in 2001 for both tillage practices, but in 2000, a tillage by rotation interaction resulted from severe crusting in S-S-S that reduced stand density and lowered yield for the chisel plow treatment. Wheat and alfalfa yields were not affected by tillage practice. Using average annual crop prices, the 5-year rotation generated returns that were 100 and 158% higher than for C-S using either no-tillage or chisel practices. This study confirms that producers who incorporate alfalfa into their crop rotations can significantly increase returns to land and management. However, returns for the rotation including alfalfa are more realistic where a viable forage market exists.</str>

    <str name="abstract">Previous pharmacological results confirmed that haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is involved in protection of cells against ultraviolet (UV)-induced oxidative damage in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seedlings, but there remains a lack of genetic evidence. In this study, the link between Arabidopsis thaliana HO-1 (HY1) and UV-C tolerance was investigated at the genetic and molecular levels. The maximum inducible expression of HY1 in wild-type Arabidopsis was observed following UV-C irradiation. UV-C sensitivity was not observed in ho2, ho3, and ho4 single and double mutants. However, the HY1 mutant exhibited UV-C hypersensitivity, consistent with the observed decreases in chlorophyll content, and carotenoid and flavonoid metabolism, as well as the down-regulation of antioxidant defences, thereby resulting in severe oxidative damage. The addition of the carbon monoxide donor carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2), in particular, and bilirubin (BR), two catalytic by-products of HY1, partially rescued the UV-C hypersensitivity, and other responses appeared in the hy1 mutant. Transcription factors involved in the synthesis of flavonoid or UV responses were induced by UV-C, but reduced in the hy1 mutant. Overall, the findings showed that mutation of HY1 triggered UV-C hypersensitivity, by impairing carotenoid and flavonoid synthesis and antioxidant defences.</str>
