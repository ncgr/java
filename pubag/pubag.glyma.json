        "abstract":"The cumulative effects of long-term (1980-1990) tillage and crop rotation management on soil organic C and N concentrations and potential mineralization were determined. Tillage systems studied were conventional moldboard plow tillage and conservation tillage, with various crop rotations including: continuous soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover (SW); continuous corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat cover (CW); and corn-wheat cover-soybean-wheat cover (CWSW). Surface soil (0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm depth increments) organic C and N concentrations and potential mineralization were determined for all tillage/rotation combinations in October 1990. After 10 years, surface soil organic C and N concentrations were 67% and 66% higher, respectively, under conservation tillage than plow tillage to a depth of 10 cm. Potential C and N mineralization followed a pattern similar to organic C and N distribution. However, differences in substrate quality below 10 cm indicated that conservation tillage promoted N immobilization. Crop rotation had less effect than tillage on soil organic C and N amounts and potential mineralization. Rotations with higher frequency of corn (CW and CWSW) had higher organic C and N concentrations and C mineralization than SW; crop rotation had no effect on potential N mineralization. Tillage system apparently influenced soil organic matter concentrations and mineralization via crop residue incorporation rather than any effects owing to concentration differences at the soil surface, while the effect of crop rotation was related to amount of crop residues added between 1980 and 1990.",

        "abstract":"Liquid swine manure can be a resource for providing essential plant nutrients and building soil resources, but its management for maximum productivity with minimum environmental impact is often very difficult. Failure to understand the challenges may result in expectations or even regulations that are impossible to achieve. Our objective is to provide producers and policy makers with information regarding agronomic and environmental challenges of liquid swine manure management based on results from a 6-year study with continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and a corn-soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. rotation in Iowa. Challenges that we encountered are openly discussed to increase the awareness of those people who may ultimately be developing policy and writing manure management legislation. Drainage volume, NO3-N concentrations, and NO3-N leaching loss were spatially variable, being influenced by seasonal precipitation as well as current and past manure application rates. Annual manure applications for continuous corn increased soil-test P and K values because more nutrients were supplied than removed through grain harvest. Biennial applications also increased soil-test P but not K. We suggest developing local manure nutrient databases to guide application rates, using total Kjeldahl N (TKN) values to estimate plant-available N. monitoring manure loads to quantify variability and actual loading rates, and routinely using soil-testing to determine if application rates should be based on P rather than N content in the manure.",

        "abstract":"Aphid infection reduces soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) yield. Consequently, cultivation of aphid-resistant strains is a promising approach to pest control, and understanding the resistance mechanism is of importance. Here, we characterized the resistance of soybeans to foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani Kaltenbach, at the metabolite level. First, we evaluated aphid mortality and settlement rates on the leaves of two soybean strains, ‘Tohoku149’ and ‘Suzuyutaka’, and found that the former had strong resistance soon after introduction of the aphids. The metabolomic response to aphid introduction was analyzed using capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found the following three features in the profiles: (1) concentrations of citrate, amino acids, and their intermediates were intrinsically higher for Tohoku149 than Suzuyutaka, (2) concentrations of several metabolites producing secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and alkaloids, drastically changed 6h after aphid introduction, and (3) concentrations of TCA cycle metabolites increased in Tohoku149 48h after aphid introduction. We also profiled free amino acids in aphids reared on both soybean strains and under starvation, and found that the profile of the aphids on Tohoku149 was similar to that of the starved aphids, but different to that of aphids on Suzuyutaka. These tests confirmed that aphids suck phloem sap even from Tohoku149. This study demonstrates the metabolomic profiles of both soybean strains and aphids, which will contribute to the molecular level understanding of mechanisms of soybean resistance to aphids.",

GA3 was tagged with 2-(2-aminoethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidine (AEMP) using N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine (HOOBt) as coupling agents in acetonitrile to produce GA3-AEMP-derivative. The GA3-AEMP-derivative was injected into CE by electrokinetic injection and detected by Ru(bpy)32+-based ECL. The parameters affecting derivatization, detection and separation such as concentration of reactants, detection potential, pH and concentration of separation buffer, were investigated in detail. Under optimum conditions, the linear concentration range for GA3 was from 2.0×10−7 to 1.28×10−4M with a correlation coefficient of 0.9997. The detection limit was 8×10−8M (S/N=3). The relative standard deviations of migration time, peak intensity and peak area for nine continuous injections of 2.0×10−5M GA3-AEMP-derivative were 1.0%, 2.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The developed approach was successfully applied to the determination of total GAs in the stem, leaf and seed of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) with recoveries in the range from 89.6% to 99.3%.",

Merr.) of Heliothis virescens (F.), were measured in a dual choice situation in a wind tunnel. Preflowering clover was more attractive than preflowering geranium, followed by preflowering vetch. Clover was preferred over geranium in flowering stages as well. No within species differences were detected for the two phenological stages. Preflowering and flowering cotton and soybean were preferred over preflowering and flowering sorghum. The findings could be important in pre-determining release sites for M. croceipes in the field.",

In this study, the effects of elevated CO₂ and fly ash amended soils on trace element accumulation and translocation in the root, stem and seed compartments in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were evaluated. Soybean plants grown in fly ash (FA) amended soil (0, 1, 10, 15, and 25% FA) at two CO₂ regimes (400 and 600ppm) in controlled environmental chambers were analyzed at the maturity stage for their trace element contents. The concentrations of Br, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in roots, stems and seeds in soybeans were investigated and their potential risk to the health of consumers was estimated. The results showed that high levels of CO₂ and lower concentrations of FA in soils were associated with an increase in biomass. For all the elements analyzed except Pb, their accumulation in soybean plants was higher at elevated CO₂ than at ambient concentrations. In most treatments, the highest concentrations of Br, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Pb were found in the roots, with a strong combined effect of elevated CO₂ and 1% of FA amended soils on Pb accumulation (above maximum permitted levels) and translocation to seeds being observed. In relation to non-carcinogenic risks, target hazard quotients (TQHs) were significant in a Chinese individual for Mn, Fe and Pb. Also, the increased health risk due to the added effects of the trace elements studied was significant for Chinese consumers. According to these results, soybean plants grown for human consumption under future conditions of elevated CO₂ and FA amended soils may represent a toxicological hazard. Therefore, more research should be carried out with respect to food consumption (plants and animals) under these conditions and their consequences for human health.",

        "abstract":"Soybean rust (SBR), caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., has the potential to cause significant economic yield loss in U.S. soybean production. Four single dominant resistance genes have been identified in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] that only confer specific resistance to a few rust isolates that have been tested. Additional resistance genes have been identified in wild perennial relatives, including G. tomentella Hayata (accession PI 483218, 2n = 78). Intersubgeneric hybrids have been created between G. max (cv. Altona) and this G. tomentella accession. Amphiploid hybrid lines (2n = 118) were the result of this hybridization and when further backcrossed to G. max (cv. Clark 63), derived fertile lines (2n = 40) were also generated. Both sets of progeny were screened at the USDA-ARS facility at Ft. Detrick, MD, to determine if the resistance to SBR was inherited in the subsequent populations. The amphiploid hybrid clones still retained the genetic SBR resistance that was found in the G. tomentella parent. However, the derived fertile lines were susceptible. These lines were not screened for SBR resistance following each backcross, which may explain this occurrence. Reinstituting the backcross procedure, while testing for SBR resistance at every generation, could move the SBR resistance gene(s) from G. tomentella to the cultivated soybean G max",

One of these resistance genes is the Rpp1 gene, which is present in the soybean accession PI 200492 The availability of molecular markers associated with Rpp1 will permit marker-assisted selection and expedite the incorporation of this gene into U.S. cultivars. We compared simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers between ‘Williams 82’ and the BC₅ Williams 82 isoline L85-2378, which contains the Rpp1 resistance allele from the soybean accession PI 200492, for candidate regions that might contain Rpp1 One candidate region was found with the SSR marker BARC_Sct_187 on linkage group G. A population of BC₆F₂:₃ lines segregating for the Rpp1 resistance locus was genotyped in this region on linkage group G followed by inoculation with the P. pachyrhizi isolate India 73-1 in the USDA-ARS Biosafety Level 3 Plant Pathogen Containment Facility at Ft.

Merrill, as food but exhibits distinct preferences among varieties. It is believed that the basis for discrimination between the resistant PI 229358 and the susceptible cv. ‘Williams' is chemical. By the ablation of chemosensilla on antennae, maxillary palpi, labial palpi, and foretarsi, followed with leaf disc preference tests, we found antennal and maxillary palp chemosensilla to be almost entirely responsible for Mexican bean beetles' discrimination between foliage of the resistant and susceptible genotypes. All appendages, and the epipharynx, were observed by scanning electron microscopy and, except for foretarsi, were found to bear several types of presumably olfactory and gustatory sensilla, which are figured and described. Since behavioral observations show that olfaction is usually sufficient to cause rejection of PI 229358, we conclude that olfactory sensilla mainly on antennae and maxillary palpi are critical in food discrimination in this system.",

Weed species and soybean were grown at three moisture levels, and spectral reflectance data and leaf water potential were collected every other day after the imposition of moisture stress at 8 wk after planting. Moisture stress did not reduce the ability to discriminate between species. As moisture stress increased, it became easier to distinguish between species, regardless of analysis technique. Signature amplitudes of the top five bands, discrete wavelet transforms, and multiple indices were promising analysis techniques. Discriminant models created from data set of 1 yr and validated on additional data sets provided, on average, approximately 80%% accurate classification among weeds and crop. This suggests that these models are relatively robust and could potentially be used across environmental conditions in field scenarios.Nomenclature: Soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.",

        "abstract":"The present study highlights the protective role of β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) in alleviating cadmium (Cd) stress in soybean. Proteomic analyses revealed that out of 66 differentially abundant protein spots in response to Cd challenge, 17 were common in the leaves of BABA-primed and non-primed plants. Oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain 1 were detected in increase abundance in both groups of leaves. Among the 15 commonly decreased protein spots, the relative intensity levels of heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein, carbonic anhydrase, methionine synthase, and glycine dehydrogenase were partially restored after BABA treatment. Moreover, BABA priming significantly enhanced the abundance of the defense-related protein peroxiredoxin and glycolytic enzymes in response to Cd exposure. Additionally, the impact of Cd on the physiological state of BABA-primed and non-primed plants was analyzed using a biophoton technique. The finding of comparatively low biophoton emission in BABA-primed leaves under Cd stress indicates that these plants experienced less oxidative damage than that of non-primed plants. Proteomic study coupled with biophoton analysis reveals that BABA pretreatment helps the plants to combat Cd stress by modulating plants' defence mechanism as well as activating cellular detoxification system to protect the cells from Cd induced oxidative stress damages.",

Cheongja 3 seed coat against H₂O₂-induced cell death of human brain neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. MAIN METHODS: Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, production and expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and inactivation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades were determined by MTT assay, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Pretreatment with anthocyanins reduced the cytotoxicity of H₂O₂ on SK-N-SH cells, dose-dependently reduced the intracellular ROS level and inactivated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1, Thr845), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins. The HO-1 and Neu1 mRNA levels were increased by H₂O₂ (25μM) and further elevated by the pretreatment with anthocyanins. Sialic acids added to the culture plates not only attenuated the cytotoxicity of H₂O₂ (25μM) but also reduced intracellular ROS level. These results suggest that Cheongja 3 black soybean seed coat anthocyanins have brain neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress (H₂O₂) by inhibiting the activation of ASK1–JNK/p38 pathways, scavenging ROS, stimulating the expression of HO-1 and, more interestingly, recruiting cellular free sialic acids through up-regulation of Neu1 sialidase gene expression. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report indicating potent health benefits of black soybean seed coat anthocyanins in neuroprotection by triggering mobilization of cellular free sialic acid and utilizing it as an additional biological antioxidant in brain neural cells.",

        "abstract":"Field studies were conducted during the years 2000 to 2003 at Stoneville, MS, to determine the efficacy of fall deep tillage and glyphosate applications on redvine and trumpetcreeper populations and soybean yield in glyphosate-resistant soybean. Fall deep (≈≈45 cm) tillage for 1, 2, and 3 yr reduced redvine density by 95, 88, and 97%%, respectively, compared with shallow (≈≈15 cm) tillage, but deep tillage did not reduce trumpetcreeper density. Glyphosate applied preplant reduced trumpetcreeper density (25 to 44%%), but not redvine density, compared to that with no glyphosate. Glyphosate early postemergence (EPOST) either alone (45 to 67%%) or followed by (fb) late postemergence (LPOST; 59 to 83%%) reduced density of trumpetcreeper, but not of redvine, compared to that with no herbicide. However, dry biomass of both vines was reduced with glyphosate EPOST or LPOST compared to that with no herbicide. Soybean yields were higher with deep tillage vs. shallow tillage, glyphosate preplant application vs. no glyphosate, and glyphosate EPOST either alone or fb LPOST vs. no herbicide. Redvine did not reestablish in 2003, which was after skipping fall deep tillage for 1 yr following three consecutive years of deep tillage compared with shallow tillage. It is possible to manage redvine infestations with fall deep tillage and trumpetcreeper infestations with glyphosate preplant and postemergence (POST) in-crop applications. Integration of fall deep tillage and glyphosate POST applications could be an effective strategy to manage combined infestations of these vines in glyphosate-resistant soybean.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; redvine, Brunnichia ovata (Walt.)

Here, we report that extracts of two soybeans, Glycine max and Rhynchosia nulubilis, and their ethyl acetate fractions increased the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), and that daidzin and genistin were the major constituents of the active fractions. Daidzin and its aglycone, daidzein, induced transcriptional activity of RAR and RARγ. FRET analysis demonstrated that daidzein, but not daidzin, bound both RAR and RARγ with EC50 values of 28μM and 40μM, respectively. Daidzein increased expression of mRNA of RARγ through direct binding of RAR and recruitment of p300 to the RARγ2 promoter. Further, mRNA and gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 were decreased by daidzein in HaCaT cells. Together, these results indicate that daidzein functions as a ligand of RAR that could be a candidate therapeutic for skin diseases.",

The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether rotation crops had different amounts of root growth, (2) whether different amounts of root growth among the crop species could be related to different levels of soluble soil C and (3) whether there were differences in P concentration among the soils under different crops that could be related to soluble C soil concentration. Roots and soil from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and a forage consisting of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and timothy (Phleum pretense L.) were sampled from the Aroostook Research Farm in Presque Isle, Maine, during the summers of 2003 and 2004 to determine root length density (RLD) and soluble C and P concentrations. Half of the sampled plots were amended with beef manure and half were not amended. Barley and forage consistently had higher RLD than potato or soybean crops. Barley and forage typically had higher concentrations of soluble soil C than potato or soybean, but the differences were significant at only three of the five sampling dates. RLD was significantly correlated to soluble C (r=0.56) only for amended soils on the August 2003 sampling date. For other dates r values were non-significant and ranged from 0.32 to 0.49. As with soil C, soluble soil P levels were typically higher in barley and forage than in potato or soybean crops. Significant differences were detected at four of the five sampling dates. Correlations between soluble C and soluble P were significant at two of the five sampling dates (r = 0.58 and 0.62) in amended soils and one of five sampling dates (r = 0.80) in unamended soils. Although the correlations between RLD and soluble C were not significant at every sampling date, the August 2003 data do suggest a possible effect of roots on soluble C. In addition, significant correlations between soluble C and soluble P at several sampling dates suggest a relationship between these parameters. Therefore cropping systems that include crops with higher amounts of root growth may promote increased soluble soil C levels and enhance P bioavailability.",

        "abstract":"Ridge tillage is a special conservation tillage method, but the long-term effect of this tillage system on crop yield and soil quality in a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation is largely unknown in the northern Corn Belt of the USA. Our objectives were to compare crop performance and soil condition at three nitrogen-fertilizer levels under ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). The experiment was started in 1990 at Brookings, SD, on a Barnes clay loam (US soil taxonomy: fine-loamy, mixed Udic Haploboroll; FAO classification: Chernozem). CT included moldboard or chisel plowing, seedbed preparation with tandem disk and field cultivator, and row cultivation. Raised beds under RT were maintained using only row cultivation. Corn grain yield was significantly (p<=0.10) greater on CT than on RT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) corn yield was 6267 kg ha-1 with RT and 6500 kg ha-1 with CT. Soybean grain yield was not significantly (p<=0.10) different between RT and CT. Average (11 years and three fertilizer-N rates) soybean yield was 1997 kg ha-1 with RT and 2058 kg ha-1 with CT. In 9 of 11 years there was a significant soybean-yield response to N-starter fertilizer. There was no significant accumulation of NO3-N in the top 3 m of soil at the end of 9 years in either tillage treatment (111 kg NO3-N ha-1 under RT and 121 kg NO3-N ha-1 under CT). Soil pH in the top 15 cm was unaffected by tillage (average pH was 6.62). In 1999, soil organic C in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under CT (56 Mg ha-1) than under RT (52 Mg ha-1). Bulk density in the top 0.2 m was significantly greater under RT (1.52 g cm-3) than under CT (1.44 g cm-3). Tillage did not have a great effect on grain yield or soil properties. RT can protect soil from erosion because crop residues remain relatively undisturbed on the soil surface in contrast to chisel plow. In this respect, we expect RT to be more sustainable over the long term than chisel plow tillage.",

        "abstract":"Producers often identify compaction as an important problem, so bulk density is usually included in minimum data sets used to evaluate tillage and crop management effects on soil quality. The hypothesis for this study was that bulk density and associated water content would be useful soil quality indicators for evaluating the transitional effects associated with changing tillage and crop management practices on deep-loess soils. The study was conducted on three deep-loess, field-scale watersheds located in western Iowa, USA. The soils are classified as Haplic Phaeozems, Cumulic-Haplic Phaeozems, and Calcaric Regosols. Watersheds 1 and 2 were converted in 1996 from conventional tillage to no-tillage, while watershed 3 was maintained using ridge-tillage and continuous corn (Zea mays L.), a practice implemented in 1972. Watershed 1 was converted to a corn--soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation while watershed 2 was converted to a 6-year rotation that included corn, soybean, corn plus 3 years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Bulk density and water content were measured at three landscape positions (summit, side-slope, and toe-slope), in 20 mm increments to a depth of 300 mm, five times between September 1996 and May 2000. Organic C and total N were also measured to a depth of 160 mm during the initial sampling. Neither bulk density nor water content showed any significant differences between the two watersheds being converted to no-tillage or between them and the ridge-till watershed. There also were no significant differences among landscape positions. Bulk densities and water contents showed some differences when adjacent sampling dates were compared, but there was no overall or consistent trend. Our results show that bulk density is not a useful soil quality indicator for these soils within the bulk density range encountered (0.8-1.6 Mg m3). Our results also confirm that producers do not necessarily have to worry about increased compaction when using ridge-tillage or changing from conventional to no-tillage practices on these or similar deep-loess soils.",

According to the EU directive 2007/68/EC, food products containing soybeans have to be labeled in order to protect the allergic consumers. Nevertheless, soybeans can still inadvertently be present in food products. The development of analytical methods for the detection of traces of allergens is important for the protection of allergic consumers. Mass spectrometry of marker proteolytical fragments of protein allergens is growingly recognized as a detection method in food control. However, quantification of soybean at the peptide level is hindered due to limited information regarding specific stable markers derived after proteolytic digestion. The aim of this study was to use MALDI-TOF/MS and MS/MS as a fast screening tool for the identification of stable soybean derived tryptic markers which were still identifiable even if the proteins were subjected to various changes at the molecular level through a number of reactions typically occurring during food processing (denaturation, the Maillard reaction and oxidation). The peptides ⁴⁰¹Val-Arg⁴¹⁰ from the G1 glycinin (Gly m 6) and the ⁵¹⁸Gln-Arg⁵²⁸ from the α′ chain of the β-conglycinin (Gly m 5) proved to be the most stable. These peptides hold potential to be used as targets for the development of new analytical methods for the detection of soybean protein traces in processed foods.",

In tests where larvae were allowed to disperse freely on plants, establishment also decreased as maturity increased, but was much lower in each stage than when confined to plants. Neonate larvae settled more quickly on terminals and expanding trifoliates than on mature trifoliates based on initiation of feeding and movement away from initial sites of placement. The ability of neonate larvae placed a short distance from soybean plants to reach a host was affected by high soil and ambient temperature. The results of these experiments suggest that larval host establishment and spin-down behavior play a major role in the late instar population distribution among soybean fields and that maturity of the host strongly influences that behavior.",
